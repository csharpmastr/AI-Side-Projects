# Executive Summary

This Philippine Clinical Practice Guidelines on the Diagnosis and Management of Chronic Heart Failure with reduced ejection fraction for Primary Care Physicians is an output of the joint undertaking of the Philippine Clinical Practice Guideline Task Force on Heart Failure, the Department of Health, and the National Institutes of Health-Institute of Clinical Epidemiology.

The task force acknowledges that heart failure is not merely a single clinical entity but rather a clinical spectrum featuring cardinal signs and symptoms (eg. breathlessness, ankle edema, easy fatigability, elevated jugular venous pressure, pulmonary rales, and peripheral edema) accompanied by objective evidence of cardiac dysfunction (structural and/or functional abnormalities of the heart). A variety of definitions and classifications has been proposed in recent international consensus guidelines.1,2 For purposes of this CPG, the definition of chronic heart failure offered in the 2021 ESC Heart Failure guidelines which identifies patients with an established diagnosis of heart failure or those who have a more gradual onset of symptoms will be adopted.1 Clinical scenarios that are characterized by signs and symptoms severe enough to warrant urgent medical attention such as hospital admission, intravenous diuretic therapy or an emergency department visit will not be covered by this CPG, as these may pertain more to acute, decompensated or worsening heart failure.1 Heart failure has also been subcategorized into specific “phenotypes” based on the left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), traditionally measured using echocardiography – 1) HF with reduced EF (EF < 40%) or HFrEF, 2) HF with mildly reduced EF (EF = 41 – 49%), or HFmrEF, and 3) HF with preserved EF (EF >50%) or HFpEF.

These clinical practice guidelines cover the diagnosis (symptoms, signs, and diagnostic tests) and management (both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic) of Filipino adults suspected of or diagnosed with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The CPG is intended to be used by primary care physicians, general practitioners, family medicine specialists, internists, and cardiologists. The guideline development process followed the widely accepted GRADE approach—Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation—including GRADE Adolopment, a systematic process of adapting evidence summaries, and the GRADE3 Evidence to Decision (EtD) framework. It included identification of critical questions and critical outcomes; retrieval of current evidence; assessment and synthesis of the evidence base for these critical questions; formulation of draft recommendations; convening of a multi-sectoral stakeholder panel to discuss values and preferences and assess the strength of the recommendations; and planning for dissemination, implementation, impact evaluation, and updating.
---
The CPG provides 20 recommendations on prioritized questions in the diagnosis and management of adults with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. These were based on the appraisal of the best available evidence on each of the 14 identified clinical questions. (Table 1), with each recommendation being supported with comments on certainty of evidence and strength of recommendation by the panel. A recommendation with a high certainty of evidence logically may merit a strong recommendation, but there are instances wherein the panel recommendation is strong despite lack of certainty of evidence, if the said recommendation is deemed to be crucial and practice-changing. The certainty of evidence indicates the volume, robustness and quality of existing literature, with meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials adding significantly more weight to recommendations. The strength of recommendation captures the overall sentiments of the consensus panel, incorporating not just the certainly on evidence but real-world feasibility and applicability. In essence, a strong recommendation is considered prescriptive and is hoped to translate to its application, while a weak recommendation is merely suggestive, as the evidence in support of such a recommendation was deemed to be uncompelling or impractical.

The impact of the local HF guidelines will definitely be far-reaching, especially in the setting of universal healthcare. Heart failure is already widely-considered as a disease that cuts across a large spectrum of specialties and fields of practice, and is not limited to the domain of the specialist. As such, the roll-out of key recommendations from these guidelines is expected to further harmonize processes, not to necessarily limit the scope of clinical practice of healthcare professionals, but rather to elevate and maintain a certain standard of care.

The recommendations in this CPG shall hold for at least three (3) years. If new and compelling evidence arises that will have an impact on relevance and application, the task force may opt to reconvene and update the said guidelines.

# Heart Failure Management Algorithm

Heart failure is a complex condition that requires careful management. This algorithm aims to help primary care physicians in managing patients with suspected or confirmed heart failure. It includes steps for the initial clinical assessment, diagnosis, pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment options as well as practice patterns.

# 1. Initial Clinical Assessment

The first step or decision checkpoint in the algorithm is to initially assess the clinical likelihood of heart failure in patients presenting with dyspnea based on signs and symptoms suggestive of the condition (Clinical Question 1). If there is paucity of clinical parameters suggestive of heart failure, alternative diagnoses may be pursued. If, however, the history and physical examination suggest heart failure, the next key decision checkpoint is determination of the presence of pulmonary and/or systemic congestion (suggested particularly by paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and elevated jugular venous pressure).

# 2. Management of Congestion

In such a situation, the clinician is advised to consider diuretic therapy (loop diuretics) and manage any identified co-morbidities, as such interventions need not be unnecessarily delayed in the absence of confirmatory laboratory tests.

# 3. Laboratory Testing

After the issue of congestion is settled, selected laboratory tests (Clinical Questions 2 to 6) can be requested to support or confirm the diagnosis (natriuretic peptides, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram) and provide baseline data for therapeutic guidance (serum electrolytes, creatinine). Confirmation of the diagnosis through laboratory testing represents the third decision checkpoint. The selection and prioritization of tests will rest not only on accuracy but also accessibility, affordability, and added information.

# 4. Echocardiography

Certain laboratory tests may provide incremental information beyond diagnosis, such as the capacity to classify, stage, or prognosticate the disease. Notice as well that the algorithm emphasizes the value of echocardiography (whether at the outset or later in the cascade) not just to help confirm the diagnosis of heart failure, but to determine its possible etiologies and classify its severity based on left ventricular ejection fraction. Since this clinical practice guideline puts the spotlight on heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), EF determination (another key decision checkpoint) will greatly aid the clinician in choosing the most appropriate and evidence-based pharmacologic therapies.

# 5. Treatment Options

Treatment of patients with heart failure includes nonpharmacologic strategies (Clinical Question 7) such as lifestyle modifications (fluid and sodium restrictions) as well as pharmacologic interventions (Clinical questions 8-12) or medications (ARNi/ACE inhibitor/ARB, beta blocker, MRA, SGLT2i). Notice that the recommendation for lifestyle modification is made early on in the algorithm, even ahead of any laboratory tests. This is to emphasize the value of nonpharmacologic interventions not just for heart failure but for many other medical conditions that may accompany it, such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity and dyslipidemia.

# 6. Guideline-Directed Medical Therapies

For patients confirmed to have HFrEF, guideline-directed medical therapies, particularly the evidence-based pillars of treatment, are recommended, as well as early discussion of palliative care. Meanwhile, those with either HFmrEF or HFpEF may still benefit from such therapies, as certain.
---
other heart failure guidelines have pointed out, but the available evidence may not be as robust as that for HFrEF. The final part of the cascade deals with clinical practice patterns (Clinical questions 13-14). The last decision checkpoint is determination of advanced heart failure (e.g. those with recurrent hospitalizations, those refractory to certain treatments, and those requiring devices) and the need for referral to higher levels of care (e.g. Level 2 or Level 3 hospitals equipped to deliver cardiovascular care) as well as palliative care.

This proposed algorithmic approach to the detection, timely diagnosis, and management of heart failure is intended to serve as a blueprint for clinicians caring for patients with suspected or confirmed heart failure. By emphasizing the value of critical thinking backed by science and real-world experience, this algorithm assists the clinician in evidence-based decision-making to afford the best possible clinical care to patients with heart failure. Moreover, such an algorithm helps assure the delivery of high-quality care in a structured manner while allowing the clinician enough elbow room to tailor-fit the strategy according to the clinical scenario. Finally, this process strikes a good balance between prudence and persistence -- the prudence to know when testing is unnecessary or even harmful, and the persistence to forge ahead with investigation to ensure timely diagnosis and treatment. Such is the spirit captured in this heart failure cascade.

# Introduction

# Background

Based on the latest data from the Philippine Statistics Authority, diseases of the heart currently account for 17.3% of the total deaths in the country, and the numbers are increasing. Among cardiovascular diseases, heart failure has a profound impact on both individual and community health. Despite a seemingly low estimated prevalence of 1.26 to 6.7%, not only is it a common cause of hospitalization, it also has a high in-hospital mortality rate of 3 to 6.7%, a 1-year mortality rate of 3.6 to 17.1% and a 1-year heart failure-related readmission rate of 9.8 to 25.7%, according to both Asian and Western studies.1 Patients with heart failure may also experience poor quality of life as the signs and symptoms of the disease may restrict their day-to-day activities. Moreover, the estimated total economic burden of heart failure hospitalization in the Philippines was reported to be around PhP 0.85 to 1.84 billion.2

In 2021, key medical societies arrived at a consensus regarding the universal definition of heart failure. Heart failure was defined as "a clinical syndrome with symptoms and/or signs caused by a structural and/or functional cardiac abnormality and corroborated by elevated natriuretic peptide levels and/or objective evidence of pulmonary or systemic congestion." In the same document, stages of heart failure were discussed: At risk for HF (Stage A), Pre-HF (Stage B), Symptomatic HF (Stage C) and Advanced HF (Stage D). A revised classification for heart failure according to left ventricular ejection fraction was also proposed: HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) for symptomatic HF with LVEF ≤40%; HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) for symptomatic HF with LVEF 41-49%; HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) for symptomatic HF with LVEF ≥50%; and HF with improved ejection fraction (HFimpEF) for symptomatic HF with a baseline LVEF ≤40%, a ≥10 point increase from baseline LVEF after treatment, and a second measurement of LVEF > 40%. Regardless of improvement in ejection fraction, it is recommended by existing guidelines to continue guideline-directed medical therapies for patients with improved ejection fraction.3,4,5

Heart failure remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide despite optimal medical management and significant advances in preventive and therapeutic strategies. People living with this condition experience bothersome symptoms that result in the restriction of daily activities, loss of productivity, an escalating cost of treatment, and poor quality of life. The real-world impact goes beyond the individual as access to quality healthcare may be compromised especially in resource-limited settings. Moreover, the clinical profile of patients with heart failure as well as the prevailing circumstances that influence clinical practice vary across regions and populations. A locally developed clinical practice guideline therefore becomes increasingly relevant to aid the Filipino clinician in the effective and timely diagnosis and management of patients with heart failure.

# Objectives

The objective of this clinical practice guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of adult Filipino patients with chronic heart failure at the outpatient clinic, with focus on HFrEF, using appropriate scientific information while considering the economic implications of diagnostic tests and non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment.

Specifically, the guideline task force addressed clinical questions that pertain to the following aspects of the diagnosis and management of adult Filipino patients with chronic heart failure:

1. Identifying signs and symptoms that are highly suggestive of chronic heart failure in adult Filipinos seen at the outpatient clinic;
2. Recommending the appropriate laboratory tests that will help establish the diagnosis of chronic HF and guide the management of chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF);
3. Justifying the nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions as well as practice patterns that will ensure the delivery of high-quality care to patients with chronic heart failure.

# Scope and Purpose

The task force on the "Philippine Clinical Practice Guidelines on the Diagnosis and Management of Chronic Heart failure with reduced Ejection Fraction for Primary Care Physicians" considers this landmark effort as the very first attempt to capture key practice recommendations on heart failure at the outpatient clinic in a single guide document. The guideline also takes into consideration existing international recommendations on diagnosis and treatment but more importantly appraises and applies such information using the lens of a Filipino healthcare provider.

# Target Population

The guideline focuses on adult patients (≥18 years of age) and with chronic heart failure seen at the primary health care setting. Although the first few clinical questions in this practice guideline approach heart failure from a general perspective, succeeding questions on treatment zero in on patients with established heart failure, particularly those with reduced ejection fraction, as the task force is cognizant of the more robust scientific evidence for therapies directed towards this classification of heart failure.

# Intended Users

The expected main end-users of this Clinical Practice Guidelines are Filipino healthcare professionals who diagnose and manage Filipino adults with chronic heart failure. This guideline will make an impact on the implementation of Universal Health Care. The main intended users of this guideline are the primary care physicians, general practitioners, family medicine physicians and the internists who will serve as frontliners in the care of the Filipino patients.

Specialists (e.g. cardiologists, nephrologists, endocrinologists) and healthcare workers in the allied professions (e.g. nurses, physical therapists) who are involved in the care of patients with chronic heart failure may also benefit from the recommendations stated in this practice guideline. Finally, administrators, policy-makers and other non-medical stakeholders (PhilHealth, HMOs, etc.) may use this document as reference for the development of their respective administrative agenda or reimbursement policies, as the document captures local information and insight regarding burden of disease and socioeconomic impact of various testing modalities and treatment options.

# CPG Development Methodology

# Guideline Preparation

This CPG was developed following the prescribed processes of the DOH for CPG development.1 Following international standards, the DOH outlined the guideline development process into four phases: preparation and prioritization; CPG generation; CPG appraisal; and implementation in the Manual for CPG Development.1

In the preparation and prioritization phase, the Steering Committee set the CPG objectives, scope, target audience, and clinical questions. The committee consulted different stakeholders in prioritizing and developing the guideline questions. They identified and formed the working groups involved in creating the evidence base and finalizing the recommendations for each clinical question included.

The Steering Committee (SC) invited relevant professional organizations to nominate individuals who can become part of the consensus panel. Selected experts, by virtue of their training background and experience in critical appraisal and guideline development were also invited by the SC to serve as evidence review experts (EREs).

The Technical Working Group includes task force members tasked with the preparation and review of evidence, and drafting of the CPG manuscript — technical coordinators, EREs, technical writer. The evidence review experts were tasked to review existing CPGs, appraise and summarize the evidence, and draft the initial recommendations. The evidence summaries were then presented to the consensus panel members to finalize the recommendations.

The consensus panel was composed of representatives from multiple sectors tasked to review the evidence summaries and develop recommendations during the en banc meeting moderated by the technical facilitator. In the meeting, they prioritized critical and important outcomes; they also discussed the necessary considerations revolving around the recommendations and voted on each recommendation and its strength.

# Composition of the CPG Task Force

The CPG Task force is composed of the 1) steering committee (SC), 2) technical working group (TWG), which includes the evidence review experts, technical coordinators, and technical facilitator, 3) consensus panel (CP), and 4) conflict of interest review committee (COI).

# Steering Committee (SC)

The steering committee (SC) is the main group that spearheaded the development of this CPG. The SC held several regular meetings to discuss organizational, budget, methodological and scientific content issues. It identified the individuals who were to be part of the other committees. They coordinated evidence summaries with the EREs, facilitated ERE and CP meetings, oversaw the writing, editing and finalization of the CPG, forwarded the final CPG manuscript for external review, and finally, submitted the CPG to the DOH for approval.

# Technical Working Group (TWG)

The Technical Working Group (TWG) is mainly concerned with the review, appraisal, consolidation and presentation of evidence. The Evidence Review Experts (EREs) were tasked with reviewing existing CPGs, creating evidence summaries, and drafting evidence-based recommendations. They developed the PICO questions in coordination with the Lead CPG developers. The Technical Coordinators (TCs) identified, reviewed, and summarized existing CPGs, and evaluated them for possible adaptation. They also coordinated the activities of the EREs, provided guidance to the EREs regarding evidence synthesis and recommendation formulation, and assisted in the writing and subsequent review of the manuscript. The TCs also coordinated with the technical facilitator in clarifying the clinical issues addressed by the research questions and prioritized for consensus panel discussion and decision-making. The Technical Facilitator (TF) was mainly tasked with presiding over the consensus panel meetings.

# Conflict of Interest (COI) Review Committee

The Conflict of Interest (COI) review committee reviewed the possible conflicts of interest of everyone involved in the development of this guideline.

# Prior Consultation

Prior to the creation of the guidelines, a formal meeting and consultation was conducted to determine the priority topics and questions to be included in the CPG. The technical coordinators and the SC leads presented the initial clinical questions, and the views of the consensus panel were sought before coming up with the initial clinical statements. A patient who has heart failure and a cardiac rehabilitation nurse were included in the meeting. The SC, TCs, EREs and the multisectoral consensus panel (CP) agreed on PICO questions to be submitted for approval by the National Practice Guideline committee. The panel also prioritized the critical and important outcome measures prior to finalizing the PICO questions, such that stakeholders’ values and preferences were incorporated. Furthermore, the panel reviewed evidence summaries and draft recommendations, and voted as well on the recommendations of the CPG.

# Evidence Synthesis

A systematic search of electronic databases such as MEDLINE via PubMed, CENTRAL, and Google Scholar for relevant literature was performed. Guidelines on heart failure management were identified and underwent assessment using the AGREE II tool. The following guidelines were selected based on the search terms of chronic heart failure guidelines and were approved by the steering committee. The following relevant guidelines were included:

- 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Guidelines for the Management of Heart Failure
- 2021 ESC Guidelines on the Management of Acute and Chronic Heart failure
- 2019 Malaysian CPG on Heart Failure
---
# 2018 JCS/JHFS Guidelines on Heart Failure

# 2021 Focused Update

# 2018 Australian Guidelines on Heart Failure

# 2018 NICE Guidelines on Heart Failure

# 2017 Canadian Guidelines

De novo systematic reviews and meta-analysis were done for each question as the guidelines were not able to answer the clinical questions developed by the SC. Databases such as MEDLINE via Pubmed, Google Scholar, and HERDIN were utilized to search the relevant literature. Meta-analysis and systematic review sites such as COCHRANE reviews and PROSPERO were used. Local databases were also reviewed for studies relevant to the clinical questions.

Keywords were based on PICO (population, intervention/exposure, comparison, outcomes), MeSH and free text, set for each question. The ERE contacted authors of related articles to verify details and identify other research studies for appraisal. The specific search terms used by the Evidence Reviewers to search for the relevant literature are found in each annex for the respective topics.

The studies included were prospective, cohort, cross-sectional, and systematic reviews for questions on diagnosis. For questions on therapy, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and network meta-analyses were included.

A data extraction tool used by Raftery et al (2015) was utilized by the evidence reviewers. The table includes the type of design, description of the clinical trial, type of RCT (superiority, inferiority, equivalence), results of the study, and other relevant information seen in the tool. Two experts filled out the extraction tool while a third reviewer was called to resolve discrepancies. Similarly, the data extraction tool was also used for clinical practice guidelines.

Health economic outcome research (HEOR) and cost-effectiveness studies, both international and local, were included in the search to answer the cost portion of the evidence-to-decision framework. If there were no studies on cost-effectiveness, the evidence reviewer checked for the cost of the diagnostic test in hospitals or diagnostic centers, and the cost of the drug in the national formulary or in drugstores. Studies on health equity and patient preferences and values were also included in the search terms to answer the EtD table.

# Study Quality Assessment

Appraisal tools for clinical studies using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale or QUADAS were utilized by the EREs in developing de novo assessments. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses using the Cochrane approach were used. Relevant local databases and websites of medical societies were also utilized in the search.
---
# Data Synthesis

Evidence reviewers appraised the directness, methodological validity, results, and applicability of each relevant clinical study or guidelines included. RevMan, STATA, and GRADE Pro were used for the quantitative synthesis of important clinical outcomes for each question. The ERE-generated evidence created summaries for each of the fourteen questions. Each evidence summary included evidence on the burden of the problem as well as on diagnostic performance, benefits, harm, and the social and economic impact of the screening test/intervention. Evidence/information that will facilitate decision-making (i.e., cost of screening test, cost-effectiveness studies, qualitative studies) were also included in the evidence summaries. The important step in the creation of this clinical practice guideline (CPG) was determining the strengths of the recommendations. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used in assessing the recommendations.

# Table 16. Basis for Assessing the Quality of the Evidence using GRADE Approach

|Certainty of Evidence|Interpretation|
|---|---|
|High|We are very confident that the true effect lies close to the estimate of the effect.|
|Moderate|We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.|
|Low|Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.|
|Very Low|We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.|
---
# Factors that lower quality of the evidence are:

- Risk of bias
- Important inconsistency of results
- Some uncertainty about directness
- High probability of reporting bias
- Sparse data/Imprecision
- Publication bias

# Additional factors that may increase quality are:

- All plausible residual confounding, if present, would reduce the observed effect
- Evidence of a dose-response gradient
- Large effect

The SC, EREs and CP identified the outcomes that were used in deciding the recommendations for the clinical questions as critical, important, or of low importance; only critical and important outcomes were selected.1 After identification, the CP validated and voted on the rating of the outcomes. All the panelists, including the patient advocate and the cardiac rehabilitation nurse, prioritized and rated the clinical outcomes that were either critical or important.

# Table 17. Cardiovascular Outcomes GRADE Score

|OUTCOME|SCORE|RANK|
|---|---|---|
|Cardiovascular Mortality|9|Critical|
|All-cause Mortality|9|Critical|
|Worsening Heart Failure|9|Critical|
|Heart Failure hospitalization|8|Critical|
|Symptom reduction|8|Critical|
|Quality of Life|8|Critical|
|Hypotension|8|Critical|
|Arrhythmia|8|Critical|
|Deteriorating Renal Function|7|Important|

# Formulating Recommendations

The evidence was assessed by the reviewers using the GRADE approach. This approach allows reviewers to make clinical recommendations, coverage decisions, and public health recommendations. The framework was built to assess the strength of recommendations.13 The recommendations were based on the quality of evidence, trade-off between the benefits and harm of the test or drug, cost-effectiveness, applicability, availability, feasibility, equity, resources and uncertainty. Factors that lowered the quality of evidence, such as publication bias, inconsistency of results and reporting bias, were considered. An Evidence to Decision (EtD) framework was used to process the gathered evidence and come up with decisions and recommendations.

The criteria used in the EtD framework that was followed by this guideline include priority of the problem, test accuracy, benefits and harms, certainty of evidence, outcome importance, balance, resource use, equity, acceptability, and feasibility. These were used by the evidence reviewers to determine the strength of recommendation and by the consensus panel in weighing the evidence and the possibility of recommending it.

The strength of each recommendation (i.e. strong or weak) was determined by the panel by considering all the factors mentioned above. Strong recommendation means that the panel is “confident that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation outweigh the undesirable effects” while weak recommendation means that the “desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effects” but the panel cannot say so with confidence. A weak recommendation means that the physician may either follow the recommendation or use another option of diagnostic test or treatment management.

The recommendation for each question and strength of each recommendation were determined through voting. A consensus decision was reached if 75% of all CP members agreed. In case that consensus was not reached in the first voting, questions and discussion were encouraged. Two further rounds of voting on an issue were conducted. Evidence-based recommendations were based on input arrived at by consensus in the en banc discussions. The recommendations presented by the evidence-based reviewers were moved forward and revised depending on the decision of the consensus panel during voting. If the decision was not reached even after three rounds of voting, a modified Delphi approach was conducted to be spearheaded by the lead of the steering committee.

There were recommendations that have been graded LOW based on the evidence presented by the reviewer; however, during the en banc meeting, the consensus panelists felt that these recommendations needed to be upgraded to a STRONG.

# Recommendation

Based on factors such as feasibility, equity, and applicability in the local setting. Thus, the CPG included recommendations that have low level of evidence but with a strong recommendation.

In cases where direct evidence was lacking and the consensus panel deemed it necessary that a statement be articulated regarding the intervention in question, a good practice statement was included. A good practice statement implies that there is general agreement that the intervention will do more good than harm.

# Guideline Dissemination

# Plan for Dissemination and Implementation

The SC discussed with relevant stakeholders such as the DOH and medical societies the preparation of a dissemination plan to actively promote the adoption of this guideline with strategies for copyrights.

The dissemination and implementation plan of this CPG includes the following:

1. Writing of an Executive Summary that will be submitted for publication in a reputable local peer-reviewed medical and cardiology journals. The summary will include a quick reference guide of all the recommendations and the algorithm to be used by primary care physicians, cardiologists and heart failure specialists, and allied medical professionals who are taking care of heart failure patients.
2. Pilot-testing of the recommended guideline-based pathway of care in identified outpatient clinics in select key cities after the publication of the executive summary. Educational webinars on the HF CPG for primary care physicians will be held. A pre-test/post-test evaluation will be conducted after the medical education. The pilot-testing will run for six months, and a survey will be conducted to measure success of the implementation. A focus group discussion will also be conducted among the primary care physicians to assess their improvement in the management of heart failure. Then, with the approval and endorsement of the DOH, the guidelines will be implemented nationwide.
3. Stakeholder medical societies (PHA, PCP, PAFP, PMA, NHFN) will be asked to participate in the dissemination of the guidelines during their annual scientific meetings and in their websites. Once the article is published, the CPG will be presented during scientific conventions and be made available on the websites of the DOH, PHC, different medical societies and organizations. Other avenues of dissemination will include press conferences, social media sites, and professional society conventions.
4. Electronic clinical decision support tools will be designed and developed to assist primary care physicians in the implementation of the guideline recommendations.
---
# 5) Rapid assessment method of evaluating adherence to guideline recommendations

may be done after one year of dissemination efforts in selected and representative outpatient practice groups by reviewing outpatient records.

The following criteria will be included to assess the success of implementation of the CPG for HFrEF. These were adapted from the guideline checklist developed by National Health Guidelines of Australia14. This checklist includes the ff: 1) systems are in place to support comprehensive care for heart failure patients, 2) awareness and distribution of the guidelines among the healthcare professionals, 3) clinical education on the guidelines, and 4) clinical care is aligned with the guidelines.

# Applicability of the Guidelines

# Facilitators and Barriers

Prior to the start of guideline development, the steering committee members discussed possible facilitators and barriers to the diagnosis and management of heart failure in the process of deciding on the coverage of the contemplated clinical practice guideline. EREs and CP members were also engaged in such discussion during the organizational meeting of the HF Task Force.

These guidelines address the needs of primary care physicians who are first to see patients suffering from heart failure in the outpatient setting. Successful implementation of the guidelines include active dissemination of the knowledge on heart failure management and measuring its impact to clinical practice among all stakeholders. Specialty societies, such as the Philippine Heart Association, and cardiology training institutions will be tapped to educate and train primary care physicians. The task force proposes that heart failure medications recommended in these guidelines be approved for inclusion in the national formulary to improve utilization of the guidelines. However, there may be barriers in the management of heart failure. There is limited availability of specialty centers and support centers for heart failure, such as heart failure clinics and cardiac rehabilitation centers. This CPG recommends that care for patients with HFrEF be coordinated with cardiologists in their hospitals. There may also be a need for heart failure clinics in the country handled by heart failure specialists who will manage difficult to treat heart failure patients.
---
# Guideline Monitoring and Evaluation

The National Institute of Health, in cooperation with the steering committee and the task force, will create guidelines on monitoring of the guidelines, from publication, dissemination, and application in clinical practice. The task force hopes that such guideline recommendations will be properly cascaded to intended users through close collaboration between the national government, key professional societies, and local health administrators. Strategies may be developed to determine real-world use of such guidelines, such as quality of care studies and validation of implementations studies, looking into adherence to key recommendations and impact of their application, whether through scorecard metrics or coordinated research, such as rapid assessment or quality of care studies. Such evaluations may be planned based on pre-specified intervals, depending on the current need of the health industry.

# External Review

The Steering Committee invited 3 external reviewers to comprise the Task Force Guideline External Review Panel. The external reviewer panel was composed of an endocrinologist/clinical epidemiologist, a clinical cardiologist, and a clinical epidemiologist/health economist, who reviewed the initial manuscript of the guidelines. All three external reviewers used 2 tools – 1) the AGREE-II checklist, to evaluate the methodological aspects of CPG development, including its reporting, and 2) the AGREE-REX checklist, to assess the technical aspects and implementability of the CPG recommendations. The SC held a meeting after receiving the external reviews and recommendations which were reviewed and considered in the revision of the final draft of the manuscript before submission to the central committee. Below is a summary of the reports of each of the three external reviewers:

# Reviewer 1

- The consensus panel should include more general practitioners or doctors from the rural health clinics to have a more balanced point-of-view in terms of applicability and feasibility of the guidelines.
- Consultation or surveys done with patient groups, instead of just including one patient in the consensus panel, should have been done prior to the creation of the guidelines.

# Reviewer 2

- Claims on the absence of economic evaluation studies - e.g., cost analysis, cost-effectiveness (CEA), cost-utility analysis (CUA), and studies on values and
---
preferences in the local setting: This is most probably true. However, this would have been better if validation was expressed through explicit statements regarding the literature search which did not yield any of such studies.

- Use of charges from different providers (government and private hospitals) for diagnostic services, etc. to represent their costs (e.g., cost of chest x-ray). Please note that cost is not the same as charges. Charges may underestimate or overestimate the real cost. For example, a government hospital may charge PHP 100-200/day for ward accommodation. This is obviously, an underestimation of the real cost considering that it must provide at least three (3) full meals a day, nursing care, and other provisions such as electricity and water. Conversely, an overestimation of the true cost can be seen in a private hospital which has higher charges for its services in consideration of profit for its operation.
- Perspective of the analysis: The importance of the perspective undertaken in an economic evaluation cannot be overemphasized. These include taking the societal (the broadest), healthcare provider or payer, or the patient’s perspective. Since the CPG is undertaken in the background of universal health care, the healthcare provider or payer perspective (government) should be the approach undertaken. Using the chest x-ray example above, if the government is to provide chest x-ray for free for every Filipino, determination of the real cost of a single chest x-ray will take into consideration the cost of the x-ray machine, the materials needed to produce the chest x-ray, fees for the personnel who are going to operate it inclusive of reader’s fees, and maintenance cost, vis-à-vis the number of chest x-rays it can produce for the lifespan of the machine. Unfortunately, this type of study may not be available at present. In the realm of the current healthcare delivery system where most of healthcare is obtained through out-of-pocket spending, “charges” could be used as “cost” using the patient’s perspective. Hopefully, as universal health care goes into full implementation the ideal analysis, i.e., the “true cost” will be determined and used.
- Issue of “hidden cost”: The tasks of an economic evaluation study consist of the following: identification, measurement, and valuation of resources, and comparison of the options being considered in terms of costs and effectiveness. The perspective of the study plays a big role in the first three tasks. For example, if one gets hospitalized for heart failure, productivity or production losses (loss of income when one gets sick) is one of the resources that is included in the hospitalization cost if the study used either the societal or patient’s perspective (but valuation may differ). However, if the healthcare provider’s perspective (government as the payer) is utilized, the cost of productivity losses is excluded.
---
This is seen in the study on the hospitalization costs for congestive heart failure in the Philippines. The study used both the societal and healthcare provider’s perspectives. There is no “hidden cost for work interruption for both the patient and the caregiver” since the non-healthcare costs which include production losses were included in the analysis using the societal perspective.

# ICERs, cost-effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness threshold, etc.

The results of CEAs and CUAs are expressed through incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). These ICERs are then compared to a threshold ICER specific to a particular setting or country to determine cost-effectiveness. An intervention is deemed cost-effective if it is below the cost-effectiveness threshold. On the other hand, an intervention assessed to be cost-effective in one country cannot be automatically deemed cost-effective in another country. This may be brought about by the differences in threshold ICERs, variations in the measurement and valuation of resources (two of the tasks of an economic evaluation study mentioned above), and prevalence. The importance of study setting is seen in the case of sacubitril-valsartan, an intervention assessed to be cost-effective for heart failure in many countries. However, a study conducted in Thailand and published in 2018 concluded that it was not cost-effective in Thailand.

Moreover, in trying to apply or express the ICER obtained in studies conducted in other countries, some resort to using the foreign exchange rate, i.e., converting the ICER expressed for example in US$ to PHP by multiplying the value in US$ by the exchange rate to arrive at the ICER in PHP. However, this practice is fraught with errors unless the ICER is expressed in purchasing power parity (PPP), e.g., US$ PPP.

The local CUA on dapagliflozin for HFrEF showed that it may be cost-effective in the Philippine setting (58-64% cost-effective for all HFrEF patients and 72-76% cost-effective for HFrEF patients with diabetes). However, there were some limitations mentioned in the study that could affect the ICERs. A recalculation of the ICERs is proposed using newer data on the cost of the medicine using the payer’s perspective (government) as well as applying the HTAC-recommended discount rate of 7%. Such data were not yet available when the study was written and subsequently published.

Lastly, the statement “tests and interventions being done for Heart Failure management was one important consideration discussed in the panel meetings/health technology assessment; it should be a key gatekeeping mechanism to ensure that all payments made by the government (through PhilHealth) are cost-effective” is well appreciated. Please refer to the above comments regarding charges as not the same as costs. In addition, ensuring that
---
# Reviewer 3

- Patient outcomes should also be considered in the recommendations, not just clinical outcomes. Tailoring of recommendations important to patients should be included in clinical practice guidelines. More patient representatives should be included when coming up with recommendations. Patient decision-making tools should be considered in the recommendations.
- The views of policy makers, (eg: Philippine Health Insurance) and administrators (e.g Department of Health and hospital administrators) should also be included in the discussions during the drafting of the clinical questions and even during the voting on recommendations. This would ensure that the recommendations are truly multisectoral in nature, and the values and preferences of the target users are considered.
- The impact of the guidelines on policy making and health funding should be considered by the clinical practice guidelines. Several drugs that were included in the recommendations are not included in the Philippine National Drug Formulary, and the guidelines should anticipate changes on the drug formulary.
- Updating the guidelines should be clear and explicitly state who will initiate the process, e.g. the Philippine Heart Association or the Heart Failure Council.

The comments from the external reviewers were already incorporated in the final draft of the final manuscript.

# Guideline Update

A proposed updating process framework for CPGs starts with assembling a group responsible for updating the CPG, consisting of methodologists and experts, similar to the original composition of the heart failure CPG task force. New issues and technologies may require experts from new fields. The actual updating process starts with a systematic search for new relevant evidence. The DOH recommends that updates may be needed if there are identified gaps in the current knowledge on the
---
# Diagnosis and Management of Heart Failure

Newly released evidence from large scale studies or clinical trials, approval of new interventions or therapies, changes in critical or important outcomes and values placed on outcomes, or changes in resources available for health care.1 A fixed time frame from two to five years had been reported in previous reviews of methodological handbooks.17 After identifying new relevant evidence, the effect or impact of this new evidence should next be assessed to determine the need for an update. This assessment should include whether this new evidence alters the validity of the current recommendations. When the need for an update is agreed upon, the new evidence is incorporated and the current recommendations are revised accordingly. A multidisciplinary external review by a panel with members not involved in the development or updating of the CPG, and including clinical and methodological experts, should also be conducted. Finally, when approved by the DOH, a summary of the updated recommendations or de novo recommendations should be published.16

Thus, updates will be planned three years after publication in anticipation of the potentially practice-changing results of ongoing and future clinical trials on heart failure. The steering committee will organize a CPG update group that will meet annually to assess latest clinical trials and observational studies that may impact the practice of heart failure management in the country. As implementing agency, the Philippine Heart Center will coordinate with the SC in the conduct of this annual review and will contact the National Institutes of Health and Department of Health for possible collaboration in updating the guidelines. Subsequently, a technical working group to look into the latest evidence, and a consensus panel to deliberate on the new recommendations, with members who may have been part of the original CPG task force, will be convened.

# Cost Implications of the Guidelines

Evidence review experts were asked to include in their search strategy cost-effectiveness studies on the diagnostic tests and medical treatments for their evidence review of the statement recommendations. The consensus panelists also considered the cost implications of each recommendation prior to voting. During some of these discussions where the ERE was able to present cost-effectiveness studies, the steering committee deemed it to be challenging to present to the Consensus Panel, given the time restrictions. Furthermore, some of the EREs were not able to retrieve such studies and are not capable of performing de novo cost-effectiveness studies. One of the external reviewers is a clinical epidemiologist and a health economist who also checked on the method of reviewing cost-effectiveness studies and offered suggestions. The Steering Committee agreed that this knowledge gap may be addressed in subsequent updates of the CPG.

We are anticipating that dissemination and implementation of the guidelines will require costs. The steering committee will come up with a budget on the implementation.
---
dissemination, assessment and evaluation of the CPG. This will be discussed with the central committee, the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Health.

Some of the medications that are recommended are not included in the national formulary and maintenance treatment for chronic heart failure at current retail prices may not be affordable to most patients. The guideline developers will hold dialogues with the Health Technology Assessment Committee who are in charge with recommending medications to be part of the national formulary to include the recommended drugs and diagnostic tests so the government can procure these medications and make them accessible to heart failure patients.

# Editorial Independence

The funding for the development of this CPG was provided by the Department of Health in preparation for the implementation of Universal Health Care. Clinical practice guideline recommendations were solely and independently formulated by the Task Force.

# Management of Conflicts of Interest

All members of the CPG Task Force such as the Steering Committee (SC), Evidence Review Experts (ERE), Technical Coordinators (TC), Consensus Panelists (CP), Technical Facilitator, Technical Writer, and Administrative Officer underwent screening for conflicts of interest through their submitted curriculum vitae and accomplished the prescribed declaration of conflict of interest forms. The COI Review Committee of the HF CPG Task Force was composed of three individuals recommended by the Steering Committee and approved by the National Practice Guideline (NPG) COI Review committee. The Steering Committee and the Task Force COI Review Committee (TFCOIRC) underwent training on screening and managing conflicts of interest. The TFCOIRC reviewed the CVs and COI forms of all the members of the task force and made recommendations regarding each CPG Task Force member’s extent of participation.

The Steering Committee (SC) invited relevant professional organizations to nominate individuals who can become part of the consensus panel. Selected experts, by virtue of their training background and experience in critical appraisal and guideline development, were also invited by the SC to serve as EREs. Such nominees were initially screened by the SC for any major and obvious conflicts of interest that may introduce bias in their decisions. Those who passed the initial adjudication underwent screening by the HF Task Force COI Review Committee. Certain consensus panelists were prohibited from voting on certain clinical questions if they possessed significant potential COIs relevant to the said questions. The process of COI evaluation was guided by the COI algorithm (Fig. 2) crafted by the UP-NIH National Practice Guideline

# Project Team

Each task force member’s curriculum vitae and declared conflicts of interest were assessed by the TFCOIRC and a decision on his/her participation was made, as follows:

- Approved with no constraint (Status A);
- Broadcast conflict at discussion (Status B);
- Cannot vote regarding certain guideline question/s (Status C);
- Disqualified or Disqualified for specific guideline question/s (Status D).

For the first batch of SCs and CPs, major COIs were identified in a significant number of nominees. These recommendations were submitted to the Steering Committee which, in turn, informed the members of the task force regarding the outcome of the COI assessment and the recommendations for the appropriate management of identified potential conflicts of interest. To manage this, the SC recruited additional members without major COI to ensure that the majority of the members of the SC and the CP had no conflicts of interest. Declaration of COI assessment was done at the start of every meeting.

# Recommendation and Evidence Summaries

# 1. Among adult Filipinos presenting with dyspnea at the outpatient clinic, how accurate are other symptoms (easy fatigability, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea) and signs (elevated jugular venous pressure, rales, and peripheral edema) in the diagnosis of chronic heart failure?

# RECOMMENDATION 1A

Among adult Filipinos presenting with dyspnea at the outpatient clinic, we recommend a careful history to include paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea for the diagnosis of chronic heart failure.

(low level of evidence, strong recommendation)

# RECOMMENDATION 1B

Among adult Filipinos presenting with dyspnea at the outpatient clinic, we recommend a careful physical examination to include the measurement of the jugular venous pressure for the diagnosis of chronic heart failure.

(low level of evidence, strong recommendation)

# CONSIDERATIONS

The consensus panel considered the following when formulating these recommendations:

- When eliciting the symptom of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) the following questions should be asked: “Have you ever been awakened at night, after 1 to 2 hours of sleep, by shortness of breath, or a sense of drowning? And was this relieved by assuming an upright position?” This question should be translated and explained using the patient’s dialect.
- The CP gave a strong recommendation despite low certainty of evidence because, based on the universal definition of HF, the presence of symptoms is the initial requirement in diagnosing heart failure. Of these symptoms, PND is a
---
Red flag with high specificity for HF when present alongside the other signs and symptoms of HF. As such, it should always be asked by the physician at bedside.

- The probability of HF increases with the number of signs and symptoms of HF present in a patient.
- Measuring the JVP is part and parcel of cardiovascular physical examination. When assessing the jugular venous pressure, the normal value of 6 to 8 cm H2O will be used. Of the physical signs suggestive of HF, elevated JVP has a high specificity for HF.
- Proper measurement of the JVP is essential in making an accurate clinical assessment of right-sided intracardiac pressure and the likelihood of heart failure. Since this bedside maneuver requires a certain degree of skill, the consensus panel raised some concerns regarding its real-world reliability and interoperator variability. Thus, the CP recommended that efforts be made to upskill primary care providers regarding the proper technique of JVP measurement, as elaborated below.
- Guide to measuring the JVP: Ensure the patient is in a relaxed position and raise the bed at 30-45 degrees. Position the neck for optimal viewing of waveforms which are better seen with the head lying directly on the examining table/bed. A well-lit room eliminates the need for direct light. Identify venous waves by looking for bifid, flicking waveform that rises when the head of the bed is lowered and sinks with inspiration. The JVP can be assessed on either side, and a carotid pulsation can be distinguished from the JVP by pressing on the RUQ while watching the neck. The JVP should rise with this maneuver whereas a carotid pulsation should not change. Measure the JVP by identifying the highest point of pulsation, extending a ruler horizontally, and adding 5 cm.

# KEY FINDINGS

Six studies (2 prospective cohorts, 4 cross-sectional studies) investigated the accuracy of clinical symptoms (easy fatigability, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea) and signs (elevated jugular venous pressure, rales and peripheral edema) compared to a reference standard (e.g. the European Society of Cardiology criteria for the diagnosis of heart failure) in the diagnosis of heart failure.

Among the clinical parameters, easy fatigability or dyspnea climbing less than one flight of stairs provided the outlier values, with a moderate sensitivity of 0.72 and a low specificity of 0.44. For the rest of the parameters, the sensitivity was generally very low.
---
ranging from 0.27 to 0.44. On the other hand, the specificity was moderate to high ranging from 0.79 to 0.93.

Two parameters have moderate to high specificity: Paroxysmal Nocturnal Dyspnea, with a specificity of 0.86 (95% CI 0.82 to 0.90), and Elevated Jugular Venous Pressure with a specificity of 0.93 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.98).

The overall certainty of evidence was rated “low” because of incorporation bias, due to the serious risk of bias introduced since the symptoms and signs (index test) being analysed are included in the diagnosis of heart failure (reference standard).

# DIAGNOSIS OF HEART FAILURE

The Universal Definition of Heart Failure was formulated through consensus development by the Heart Failure Society of America, the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology, and the Japanese Heart Failure Society. The report was published in 2021.

The criteria for diagnosis include clinical symptoms and signs corroborated by objective evidence of structural and/or functional abnormality of the heart from Chest X-ray, NT-ProBNP, BNP, or Echocardiography. In their report, ECG was not mentioned but they noted that an elevated jugular venous pressure estimated by an experienced clinician could be accepted as objective evidence.

In the Philippines, 40% of healthcare services are accessed through primary care facilities, while 58% of those who visited health care facilities were in rural areas. It is reasonable to assume that the majority of heart failure patients are diagnosed and managed in primary care with limited access to even simple diagnostic procedures such as ECG and Chest X-ray. The clinical symptoms and signs may be useful in the early detection of heart failure. The benefits of early detection and timely treatment include an increase in life expectancy by 51% and a reduction in hospitalization by 33% when treated with ACE-inhibitors. On the other hand, eliciting the symptoms and signs requires clinical skills. A delay in the diagnosis of heart failure due to inadequate clinical skills will lead to worsening symptoms, hospital admission, or sudden death.

# REVIEW METHODS

A systematic search was done for all published studies from inception to December 6, 2022 using Medline with combined MeSH and free text search using the terms “heart failure,” “dyspnea,” “easy fatigability,” “orthopnea,” “paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,” “elevated jugular venous pressure,” “rales,” “peripheral edema,” “sensitivity,” “specificity,” “predictive value,” “diagnostic accuracy,” and “likelihood ratio,” with supplementary checks of reference lists of all studies that met the inclusion criteria and
---
the reference list of the 2021 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines on Heart Failure.

Only studies on chronic heart failure in adults seen in general, outpatient, or primary care practice were included. The risk of bias was assessed using the Painless Evidence Based Medicine criteria.6

For the interpretation of the measures of diagnostic accuracy, the following cut-offs were applied: sensitivity and specificity were considered “High” if they exceeded 90%, “Moderate” if they were at least at 80%, and “Low” if they were less than 60%.4,7

# RESULTS

Six studies7-12 with a total of 8,813 patients were included in the reviews (Table 1). Two were prospective cohort studies—one from England11 and the other from the U.S.A.10 and four were cross-sectional studies—three from the Netherlands7,9,12 and one from Portugal.8

All the studies included patients from a primary care or general practice setting. The symptoms and signs of heart failure were evaluated by general practitioners.

For the symptom of Paroxysmal Nocturnal Dyspnea, only one study described how this was elicited from the patient’s medical history. Participants were asked “Have you ever been awakened at night by troubled breathing?”.10

For the physical examination finding of elevated jugular venous pressure, one study defined this as greater than 6cm.8 None of the studies described the procedure for the measurement.

The population of patients were mostly from a random selection of patients presenting with non-acute symptoms of heart failure, except for one study on COPD patients.9 One study reported dyspnea at less than one flight of stairs and this was interpreted as easy fatigability.7 Four studies used the European Society of Cardiology’s criteria for heart failure (signs and symptoms alongside evidence of cardiac dysfunction by chest X-ray or echocardiography) as reference standard.7,8,11,12 Two studies used clinical consensus based on signs and symptoms of heart failure alongside chest X-ray or the use of heart failure medicines10; and signs and symptoms of heart failure alongside ECG, chest X-ray, NT-ProBNP, or echocardiography.9

# DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY FINDINGS

Each study contributed to one or more parameters for the clinical signs and symptoms (Table 19): easy fatigability, one study,7 n=721; orthopnea, four studies,7-10 n=7,955; paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, three studies,7,8,10 n=7,550; elevated jugular venous pressure, three studies,7-9 n=2,184; rales or lung crepitations, five studies,7,8,9,11,12 n=3,042; and peripheral edema, five studies,7,8,9,101,12 n=3,042.

Among the clinical parameters, easy fatigability or dyspnea at less than one flight of stairs provided the outlier values, with a moderate sensitivity of 0.72 and a low specificity of 0.44. For the rest of the parameters, the sensitivity was generally very low ranging from 0.27 to 0.44. The specificity was moderate to high ranging from 0.79 to 0.93.

Two parameters have moderate to high specificity: Paroxysmal Nocturnal Dyspnea with a specificity of 0.86 (95% CI 0.82 to 0.90) and Elevated Jugular Venous Pressure with a specificity of 0.93 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.98).

# CERTAINTY OF EVIDENCE

All studies had incorporation bias since the index test results (the symptoms and signs of heart failure) are part of the reference standard (the symptoms and signs of heart failure alongside objective evidence of cardiac dysfunction from ECG, chest x-ray, or echocardiography). The certainty of evidence was downgraded two steps to “Low.”

All the studies had a significant degree of inconsistency or heterogeneity but this could be explained by differences in the definition of symptoms and in the manner by which these were elicited, which is highly dependent on experience and skill. As a result of these differences, inter-observer variability in the assessment of clinical parameters was an expected outcome and could not be eliminated; thus, the certainty of evidence was not rated down for this parameter.

(https://gdt.gradepro.org/app/handbook/handbook.html#h.g2dqzi9je57e)

The studies were not rated down for directness except for the parameter for easy fatigability. Easy fatigability was defined as dyspnea on climbing one flight of stairs. There is no generally accepted definition of easy fatigability but this is usually a perception of tiredness rather than dyspnea. The certainty of evidence for this parameter was downgraded to very low.

The studies had narrow confidence intervals for sensitivity and specificity and had no serious imprecision.

# RECOMMENDATIONS FROM OTHER GROUPS

The Universal Definition of Heart Failure was formulated through consensus development by the Heart Failure Society of America, the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology, and the Japanese Heart Failure Society. It has been endorsed by the Canadian Heart Failure Society among others. They recommend a careful and thorough history taking and physical examination to guide the choice of subsequent tests and management.

# Table 20. Recommendations from recent guidelines on the use of symptoms and signs of heart failure

# ONGOING STUDIES

There is one local study on the accuracy of history taking and physical examination in the diagnosis of heart failure. This was excluded because it was conducted in a cardiology specialty clinic at the Philippine General Hospital. This study was done in 1999 and the reference standard used was echocardiographic findings. The sensitivity of orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and pedal edema were moderate to low (81, 60, and 45 respectively), while elevated JVP and pedal edema had high specificity (95 to 100%).

# COST

There are many challenges on the conduct of economic evaluations especially on cost-effectiveness studies for diagnostic tests. Modelling will not only include accuracy of the
---
# Patient’s Values and Preference, Equity, Acceptability, and Feasibility

The diagnosis of heart failure requires the presence of symptoms and signs elicited by a physician or a trained health worker corroborated by objective evidence of cardiac dysfunction from 12L ECG, Chest X-ray, NT ProBNP, or Echocardiography. The feasibility of carrying out the diagnostic process depends on the availability of health resources.

# Primary Care in the Philippines

# Health Care Facilities

Only half of the population has access to Rural Health Units (RHUs) within 30 minutes. BARMM (Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao), Bicol and MIMAROPA (Mindoro, Marinduque, Romblon, Palawan) have the highest share of populations without access to an RHU. Only half of the total barangays have at least 1 Barangay Health Station (BHS). Meanwhile, the country has 1,112 X-ray machines or one X-ray machine for every 10,000 people.

# Human Resources

In primary care facilities such as Rural Health Units and Barangay Health Stations, human resources for health are scarce. Although 90% of RHUs have at least 1 medical doctor, less than 10% of BHSs have medical doctors and nurses. These are manned by midwives and barangay health workers.

# Health Care Financing

In 2018, 54% of health care spending was from household out-of-pocket expenses. The Philippines spends USD 12 (Php 675) per person on primary care. On average, local government units (LGUs) spend PHP 390 per person on health.

# 2. Among adult Filipinos presenting with signs and symptoms of chronic heart failure at the outpatient clinic, how accurate is the chest X-ray for the diagnosis of heart failure?

# CONSIDERATIONS

The consensus panel considered the following when formulating these recommendations:

- The availability of chest X-ray and its affordability in different localities, especially in far-flung areas, are variable.
- Pulmonary congestion is characterized by an increase in pulmonary vascular markings bilaterally according to the interpretation of a skillful physician.
- The severe form of pulmonary congestion is pulmonary edema seen as fluffy infiltrates or alveolar flooding.
- Pulmonary congestion may occur even in the absence of cardiomegaly.
- A strong recommendation for the test was made despite low certainty of evidence since the presence of pulmonary congestion and/or cardiomegaly seen on the

# KEY FINDINGS

- A pooled de-novo meta-analyses had seven studies that investigated the accuracy of the chest X-ray in diagnosing heart failure (HF) among adult patients presenting with signs and symptoms of chronic heart failure in a non-emergency setting was performed. All had an observational cross-sectional study design with prospective data collection.
- Key results on radiographic cardiomegaly:
1. The sensitivity and specificity of cardiomegaly on chest X-ray to diagnose HF among adult patients with signs and symptoms of chronic HF ranges from 59-71% and 59-81%, respectively.
2. The overall certainty of evidence is high.
- Key results on radiographic pulmonary congestion:
1. The sensitivity and specificity of pulmonary congestion on chest X-ray to diagnose HF among adult patients with signs and symptoms of chronic HF ranges from 25-86% and 73-96%, respectively.
2. The overall certainty of evidence is low due to inconsistency and imprecision.

# INTRODUCTION

The chest X-ray is a projection radiograph of the chest that is used to visualize certain organs (heart, lungs, aorta, major airways, trachea) and the bones of the thorax. Its important, direct benefits in the evaluation of patients presenting with the signs and symptoms of chronic HF are the following: it enables the diagnosis of the clinical characteristics of HF (cardiomegaly, cardiac chamber enlargement, pulmonary venous congestion, and interstitial or alveolar edema); and assesses alternative cardiopulmonary causes of the patient’s signs and symptoms.1,2 Its main, direct harm is radiation exposure. The radiation dose of a single posteroanterior chest film ranges from 0.02 mSv3,4 to 0.1 mSv5 which is comparable to 10 days’ exposure to natural background radiation5 and corresponds to a negligible estimated cancer risk.6
---
context, a round-trip flight from New York to London has an approximate mean individual radiation dose of 0.1 mSV.7

The chest x-ray has also been shown to have prognostic value for heart failure onset, morbidity, and mortality. Epidemiologic population-based data from the Framingham Study reported that cardiomegaly (defined as a cardiothoracic ratio exceeding 0.5 on chest film) had an OR of 2.22 (95% CI 1.63-3.01, p &lt;0.01) in men and an OR of 1.61 (95% CI 1.21-2.16, p 0.001) in women for developing new heart failure across 38 years of follow-up.8 In a population of 7,599 patients with symptomatic heart failure of at least four weeks’ duration (with mixed HFpEF and HFrEF etiologies), cardiomegaly (defined by current or prior chest X-ray having cardiothoracic ratio of ≥0.5) had a hazard ratio of 1.35 (95% CI 1.23, 1.47) while pulmonary edema had a hazard ratio of 1.26 (95% CI 1.03, 1.54) for predicting cardiovascular death or heart failure-related hospitalization during a median follow-up of 38 months (range 2–4 years).9 In ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure from the Digitalis Investigation Group Trial, patients with high cardiothoracic ratio (&gt;0.50) had a higher all-cause mortality rate (34.3% or 1,185 per 10,000 patient-years of follow-up) compared to patients with a normal cardiothoracic ratio (28.5% or 919 per 10,000 patient-years of follow-up), and a computed hazard ratio of 1.35 (95% CI 1.21-1.51, p&lt;0.0001). All-cause hospitalization occurred in 66.2% (a rate of 3,932 per 10,000 patient-years) of patients with high cardiothoracic ratio compared to 64.8% (rate of 3,513 per 10,000 patient-years) of patients with a normal cardiothoracic ratio, with a computed hazard ratio of 1.10 (95% CI 1.01-1.20, p=0.032).10

A systematic literature search was done on electronic databases (Medline, Google Scholar, HERDIN Plus, and Cochrane Database for Systematic Reviews) on January 2, 2023. Both MeSH and free text search was done using the key words: “congestive heart failure”, “chest x-ray/chest radiography”, “sensitivity”, “specificity”, “ambulatory care”, and “primary care”. The references of the included studies and published meta-analyses were also searched. The inclusive dates of the search were from database inception until January 2, 2023. There were no limits on publication language. The search strategy is available in Annex 4, Appendix II.

The included studies for the meta-analysis were appraised using the QUADAS-2 Tool as recommended by Cochrane for Cochrane Reviews of diagnostic test accuracy. The data was summarized using RevMan 5.4. The PRISMA flow diagram for the pooled meta-analysis is available in Annex 4, Appendix III.

In this review, cardiomegaly on chest X-ray is defined as a cardiothoracic ratio measurement of greater than 0.50 on a postero-anterior view chest X-ray. Pulmonary congestion on chest X-ray is defined as the presence of cephalization, Kerley lines, and/or bilateral alveolar edema on a postero-anterior view chest X-ray.

# RESULTS

# Characteristics of Included Studies

Seven observational cross-sectional studies were found eligible from the systematic literature search and were subsequently included in the pooled meta-analysis. Six were foreign studies and one was a local study. Of these seven studies, four studies had a study population of primary/ambulatory care patients with signs and symptoms of chronic HF; one study had a population of diagnosed chronic HF patients; one study had a population of angiographically significant coronary artery disease; and one study had a population of patients referred for echocardiography.

Five studies utilized the postero-anterior view of the chest x-ray; two of these studies had an additional lateral view; while two other studies did not specify the chest x-ray view.

The reference standard differed among the included studies—three studies used clinical HF diagnosis by a physician; two studies used echocardiographic left ventricular dysfunction only; and two studies used left ventricular dysfunction on invasive hemodynamic studies only.

# Accuracy Measures and Certainty of Evidence

# Cardiomegaly on CXR

Meta-analysis of five studies11-15 on cardiomegaly on chest X-ray resulted in a sensitivity point estimate range of 0.59-0.71 and a specificity point estimate range of 0.59-0.81. Cardiomegaly was defined as a cardiothoracic ratio greater than 0.5 in all studies. Patient numbers for two studies (Harlan 1977 and Shah 2004) were not reported and were derived from the reported sensitivity and specificity percentages. The forest plot of this meta-analysis is available in Annex 4, Appendix I. There was no visually significant heterogeneity for both the sensitivity and the specificity forest plots.

Overall risk of bias for all studies was low, with two studies with a risk-of-bias issue (Harlan 1977 had unclear risk of bias in the index test criterion, and Shah 2004 had unclear risk of bias in the flow and timing criterion). The risk of bias summary is shown in Annex 4, Appendix V. The details of the QUADAS-2 Tool risk of bias assessments are available in Annex 4, Appendix VI.

The overall test accuracy certainty of evidence (CoE) for cardiomegaly on chest x-ray is high. The GRADEPRO Summary of Findings table for this meta-analysis is available in Annex 4, Appendix VII.

# Pulmonary Congestion on CXR

The meta-analysis of five studies11,12,14,16,17 regarding pulmonary congestion on chest X-ray resulted in a sensitivity point estimate range of 0.25-0.86 and a specificity point estimate range of 0.73-0.96. Pulmonary congestion was defined in four studies as pulmonary vascular redistribution or interstitial edema or alveolar edema, except for Spinar 1992 (definition was not available). Patient numbers for one study17 were not reported and were instead derived from the reported sensitivity and specificity percentages. The forest plot of this meta-analysis is available in Annex 4, Appendix I.

Qualitative analysis showed that the overall risk of bias for all studies was low, although two studies had risk-of-bias issues (Fox 2000 had an unclear risk of bias in the index test criterion, while Spinar 1992 had an unclear risk of bias in the patient selection and index test criteria because the full text of this study was not available). The risk of bias summary is shown in Annex 4, Appendix V. The details of the QUADAS-2 Tool risk of bias assessments are available in Annex 4, Appendix VI.

                  Landray et al. reported that among primary care patients suspected of heart failure, the
                  chest X-ray with cardiomegaly or pulmonary edema has a sensitivity of 65% and a
                  specificity of 45% to detect echocardiographic left ventricular systolic dysfunction.18 The

                  RECOMMENDATIONS FROM OTHER GROUPS

                  The predetermined seven medical society guidelines mention the chest X-ray as a
                  diagnostic test for patients suspected of heart failure. Three guidelines found limited/low
                  quality of evidence but have a strong strength of recommendation (AHA/ACC, ESC,
                  Australia and New Zealand). Three guidelines with a strength of recommendation
                  system did not specify their strength of recommendation (Malaysian, Canadian,
                  Japanese). UK’s NICE has no strength of recommendation system.

# To confirm the diagnosis and determine the type of HF and its etiology, the following should be performed:

Basic investigations such as ECG, Chest Radiography, blood and urine tests.

# NICE Guideline on Chronic heart failure in adults: diagnosis and management

# Perform an ECG and consider the following tests to evaluate possible aggravating factors and/or alternative diagnoses:

chest X-ray.

# National Heart Foundation of Australia and Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand Guidelines for the Prevention, Detection, and Management of Heart Failure

# A chest X-ray is recommended in patients with either a suspected diagnosis or a new diagnosis of heart failure to detect signs of pulmonary congestion, and to identify alternative cardiac or noncardiac causes for the patient’s symptoms.

A chest X-ray may rule in the diagnosis of heart failure or identify an alternative cause for the patient’s symptoms; however, a normal chest X-ray does not rule out heart failure.

# PATIENT’S VALUES AND PREFERENCE, EQUITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND FEASIBILITY

# Feasibility

There is reported variability in the ability of physicians to diagnose HF from a CXR. Specialty training is a factor in the accuracy of chest X-ray interpretation for heart failure. The accuracy measurements of the ability of emergency physicians to recognize congestion from heart failure on chest X-ray had a sensitivity of 59%, and a specificity of 96%; while those of a radiologist had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 100%.26 Another study reported that the proportion of agreement between emergency physician interpretations and radiologist reports for congestive heart failure cases was 41.4%.27

Clinical experience is also a factor in the accuracy of chest X-ray interpretation for heart failure. The agreement in chest X-ray heart failure interpretation between radiology residents and a radiology expert panel was 35%, while the agreement between radiology attendings and the radiology expert panel was 65%.28

# Acceptability

There is available evidence from the following international data on physicians’ use and perceptions of the chest X-ray for the diagnosis of heart failure:

# 1. According to physician specialty/subspecialty

The Study group on HF Awareness and Perception in Europe (SHAPE) surveyed 2,041 randomly selected cardiologists, 1,881 internists and geriatricians, and 2,965 primary care physicians (PCP) regarding the diagnosis and treatment of HF (left ventricular ejection fraction <40%). The chest X-ray was reported to be used routinely in patients under clinical suspicion of heart failure of unknown etiology by 85% of the internists/geriatricians compared to 79% of the
---
cardiologists. The chest X-ray was considered necessary to detect heart failure by 61% of the PCPs. The PCPs’ direct access to a chest X-ray within one month was reported by 65% of the PCPs.29

A study on a random sample of primary care physicians across six European countries regarding their perceptions on diagnostic and prescription issues in heart failure reported that the chest X-ray was the most routinely used test for the diagnosis of heart failure (86% or 252/294 of the study participants), followed by the electrocardiograph (72% or 212/294), and then by echocardiography (38% or 111/294).30

A Polish study on the knowledge of primary care physicians, cardiologists, and internal medicine physicians about CHF diagnosis and treatment reported that 58-86% of the questioned physicians ordered a chest X-ray to establish the diagnosis of chronic heart failure.31

A Polish study on the knowledge of primary care physicians regarding the diagnosis and treatment of chronic heart failure reported that almost 80% of surveyed physicians routinely performed ECG and chest radiogram in order to diagnose CHF.32

# 2. According to age

A Polish study on 591 general practitioners’ (GP) knowledge about heart failure reported that the chest X-ray was used in heart failure diagnosis by 34.3% of GPs aged 24-39 years, by 50.5% of GPs aged 40-55 years, and by 62.6% of GPs aged 56 years and older.33

Aside from medical societies’ guideline recommendations and the aforementioned studies on physicians’ use of the chest X-ray for the diagnosis of HF, there are no other currently available studies regarding the acceptability of using a chest X-ray for the diagnosis of heart failure among different stakeholders (eg, patients, health insurance, health policymakers, etc.).

# Patient’s Values and Preferences

The reviewer likewise did not encounter any local studies on patients’ values and preferences regarding the chest X-ray as a diagnostic test for heart failure.

# Equity

The reviewer did not come across studies on the impact of using the chest X-ray for the diagnosis of heart failure on health equity.

# 3. Among adult Filipinos presenting with signs and symptoms of heart failure at the outpatient clinic, how accurate is the 12-lead electrocardiogram for the diagnosis of heart failure?

# CONSIDERATIONS

The consensus panel considered the following when formulating these recommendations:

- The CP gave a strong recommendation to not use the 12L ECG solely for the diagnosis of chronic heart failure despite low certainty of evidence because the 12L ECG can be utilized to guide management as it may provide information on underlying structural, functional, or rhythm abnormalities, as well as effects of medications.
- Despite lack of studies regarding the utility of the 12L ECG in the diagnosis of HF, the panel suggested that it is good practice to include 12L ECG in the initial evaluation of HF.
- The panelists discussed concerns regarding the accuracy of ECG interpretation among physicians. There is a lack of local data comparing ECG reading accuracy between general physicians, primary care physicians, and specialists.
---
# KEY FINDINGS

Seven studies (all cross-sectional studies) investigated the accuracy of a 12L-ECG compared to a reference standard (ESC criteria for the diagnosis of heart failure or signs and symptoms of heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction) in the diagnosis of chronic heart failure in a general practice setting.

In all of these studies, the ECG criteria for defining abnormality were broad and not limited to findings of chamber enlargement or atrial fibrillation.

A de novo meta-analysis based on these seven studies showed that an abnormal ECG has a sensitivity of 0.755 (95%, CI 0.657 to 0.832) and a specificity of 0.672 (95%, CI 0.564 to 0.765).

The certainty of evidence is very low due to risk of bias, indirectness, inconsistency, and imprecision.

Despite low certainty of evidence, the consensus panel still gave a strong recommendation to use the 12L ECG for the diagnosis of chronic heart failure but not as the sole diagnostic test.

# INTRODUCTION

The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a graphical display of electrical signals recorded on the body surface. These signals are generated by the atrial and ventricular heart muscles in each cardiac cycle. The ECG can reflect underlying cardiac pathology such as:

- a. Chamber enlargement, represented by ECG changes that suggest left ventricular hypertrophy or left atrial enlargement;
- b. Ischemia, represented by Q waves and ST-T wave changes that suggest myocardial infarction; and
- c. Arrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation, the most common type of arrhythmia in patients with heart failure.

In determining the accuracy of ECG in the diagnosis of chronic heart failure, it is important to consider who is doing the interpretation and the criteria used for defining an abnormal ECG.

In a study conducted in the UK that compared the ECG interpretation of a general practitioner and that of a hospital physician for 137 suspected heart failure patients from the community, the sensitivity of an ECG interpreted by the general practitioner (53%)

was significantly lower than an ECG interpreted by a hospital physician (95%).1 On the other hand, the mean sensitivity of 123 Scottish GPs reviewing 180 ECGs was higher at 94%.2 In South Africa, a cross-sectional study among 93 GPs showed a competency of less than 35% for correctly identifying atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction.3

Studies on the diagnostic accuracy of the ECG also used different criteria to define abnormality. Using a broad criteria for ECG abnormality increases the sensitivity but decreases the specificity.

# REVIEW METHODS

A study estimating the accuracy of 19 ECG variables for the diagnosis of heart failure in 1,058 patients in a community setting showed the following (Table 26):4

**Table 26. Estimated sensitivity and specificity of ECG variables for the diagnosis of heart failure in the primary care setting4**
|Characteristic|Sensitivity %|Specificity %|
|---|---|---|
|Abnormal ECG|81.14|51.01|
|Atrial fibrillation|13.45|95.66|
|Left atrial enlargement|17.88|91.97|
|Left ventricular hypertrophy|29.77|89.24|
|Abnormal Q wave|3.4|98.11|
|Poor R wave progression|9.49|96.01|
|Ischemic ST-T changes|15.21|93.11|
|Nonspecific ST-T abnormalities|41.83|74.52|
|Left bundle branch block|6.52|98.1|
|Right bundle branch block|6.69|92.82|

Each individual ECG parameter has a very low sensitivity of 3-40% but taken together as any abnormal ECG, the sensitivity increases to 81%. Conversely, each individual ECG parameter has a very high specificity, mostly greater than 90%, but taken together as any abnormal ECG, the specificity decreases to 51%.

A systematic search using MeSH and free text search using the following keywords: “heart failure”, “electrocardiogram”, “sensitivity”, “specificity”, and “primary care” was performed on Medline in `, on HERDIN online on April 18, 2023, and on the Cochrane Database for Systematic Review on April 19, 2023. Citations from the retrieved studies and guidelines were also reviewed and appraised. The inclusive dates of the search were from database inception to the date of the search.

# The criteria for inclusion for this clinical question are the following:

|Table 27. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria|Table 27. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria|
|---|
|Inclusion Criteria|Exclusion Criteria|
|Population: adult population with signs and symptoms of heart failure|Acute heart failure|
|Index test: 12L ECG|Admitted patients|
|Reference Standard: ESC criteria for the diagnosis of heart failure or signs and symptoms of heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction.|Pediatric patients|

Types of studies: meta-analyses, validity studies in the community or out-patient setting

The risk of bias of the studies included in the meta-analysis were appraised using the Painless Evidence-Based Medicine criteria. The data was summarized using Meta-DiSC 2.0, a freeware software for the meta-analysis of studies on Diagnostic Test Accuracy.

# RESULTS

# Characteristics of included studies

A systematic search of the published literature yielded 7 cross-sectional studies.

# For the population:

These were adult patients from a general practice setting. Four studies were on patients with signs and symptoms of heart failure, two studies were on randomly selected patients, with or without symptoms of heart failure, and one study was on COPD patients.

# For the Index test:

Only one study was on ECG as the primary index test. The other studies included ECG in the baseline characteristics.
---
Regarding the criteria for defining abnormal ECG, two studies included any abnormality; 8,9 four studies included atrial fibrillation 4,7,10,12; three studies included left ventricular hypertrophy; 4,10,11 and three studies included ischemia. 4,7,10

Regarding the ECG reader, four studies had their ECGs read by cardiologists; 4,7,9,10 the reader was not reported in three studies 8,11,12 but in a meta-analysis, it was mentioned that they were either read by a cardiologist or by automatic reading. 13

Regarding the reference standard, four studies used the ESC criteria for heart failure; 4,9,11,12 two studies used signs and symptoms of heart failure accompanied by a LVEF <40% or atrial fibrillation; 7,8 one study used a consensus diagnosis. 10

Regarding the measurement of accuracy, the sensitivity and specificity of the ECG was reported in two studies. 4,10 Meanwhile, it was computed from a 2 x 2 table in five studies 7,8,9,11,12 and only one reported the sensitivity and specificity of the individual ECG parameters. 4

Regarding the risk of bias, four studies had high risk of bias from incorporation bias. 7,9,10,12 The characteristics of the included studies are summarized in Appendix III.

# Accuracy Measures and Certainty of Evidence

A de novo meta-analysis based on these seven studies showed that an abnormal ECG has a sensitivity of 0.755 (95%, CI 0.657 to 0.832) and a specificity of 0.672 (95%, CI 0.564 to 0.765).

The certainty of evidence was rated “very low” because of incorporation bias (ECG was part of the reference standard for the diagnosis of heart failure), indirectness (the ECG reading was not done by general practitioners), and inconsistency and imprecision from the broad ECG criteria used for defining abnormality.

The forest plot for the meta-analysis is shown in Annex 5, Appendix IV, while the GRADEpro Summary of Findings table is shown in Annex 5, Appendix V.

Based on the sensitivity and specificity, the estimate of effect per 1000 patients tested in terms of the number of patients correctly diagnosed is shown in Table 27.

# 2019 Malaysian CPG on Heart Failure

# Key Recommendation # 2:

To confirm the diagnosis and determine the type of HF and the aetiology, the following should be performed:

- Basic investigations such as ECG, Chest Radiography, blood and urine tests.

# 2018 JCS/JHFS Guidelines on Heart Failure; 2021 Focused Update

In the diagnosis of heart failure, patients should be examined first for symptoms, medical history, their family history, physical findings, ECG, and chest X-ray findings.

# 2018 Australian Guidelines on Heart Failure

A 12-lead ECG is recommended in patients with either a suspected diagnosis or new diagnosis of heart failure to assess cardiac rhythm, QRS duration, and the presence of underlying conditions such as myocardial ischaemia or LV hypertrophy.

# 2018 NICE Guidelines on Heart Failure

Perform an ECG and consider the following tests to evaluate possible aggravating factors and/or alternative diagnoses: CXR, Blood tests, urinalysis, spirometry.

# 2017 Comprehensive Update of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines for the Management of Heart Failure

We recommend that a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) be performed to determine heart rhythm, heart rate, QRS duration, and morphology, and to detect possible etiologies.

# COR-Class of Recommendation, 1-Strong, LOE - Level of Evidence, C-EO - Consensus of expert opinion

Class 1 - Evidence and/or general agreement that a given treatment or procedure is beneficial, useful, effective.

Level C - Consensus of opinion of the experts and/or small studies, retrospective studies, registries.

Seven clinical practice guidelines from other medical groups were reviewed. The AHA, ESC, Australian Guidelines, and the Canadian Cardiovascular Society recommended taking an ECG to optimize management, identify etiologies or underlying conditions, or guide therapy. They gave a strong recommendation based on low quality evidence. Two guidelines recommended taking an ECG (Malaysian guidelines, Japanese guidelines) for the diagnosis of heart failure. These did not specify the strength of recommendation or quality of evidence.

The NICE also mentioned taking an ECG to identify underlying conditions such as atrial fibrillation but did not specify the strength of recommendation or quality of evidence.

# ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR EVIDENCE TO DECISION (ETD) PHASE

# COST

The 12 L ECG is relatively affordable and is available in almost all centers in the country. The cost of the test ranges from Php 250 to Php 1,500.

A health economic study in India showed that ECG screening at primary health centers among patients with high risk cardiovascular disease saves 2.90 life years at an incremental cost of 89.97 USD (6657.47 INR), yielding a cost-effectiveness ratio of 31.07 USD (2,299.06 INR) per life-year saved, which is below the willingness to pay threshold. 23

The reviewer did not encounter local health economic studies or cost-effectiveness studies done on the performance of the test on our specific subset of patients.

# PATIENT’S VALUES AND PREFERENCES, EQUITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND FEASIBILITY

There are no studies on patients’ values and preferences regarding 12L ECG as a diagnostic test for heart failure in our population.

# ONGOING STUDIES

SOBOTA-HF is a cross-sectional heart failure prevalence study which will target 2861 patients in urban communities in Slovenia. Diagnostic studies will include the 12L ECG. Adjudication of a diagnosis of heart failure will be done by an international expert panel.24

# GOOD PRACTICE STATEMENTS

The GRADE working group has provided guidance for the writing of good practice statements despite their concern over the inappropriate use of good practice statements by guideline panels.25 “A good practice statement is developed when there appears to be high certainty that the desirable effects of an intervention clearly outweigh its undesirable effects, but the body of supportive evidence is indirect and other criteria for their development are fulfilled.”26

The GRADE working group guidance proposes the following five criteria for considering the development of good practice statements: “1) the statement should be clear and actionable; (2) the message should be necessary for actual healthcare practice (ie, without the guidance, clinicians would fail to make the appropriate decision); (3) after considering all relevant outcomes and potential downstream consequences, implementing the GPS would result in large net positive consequences; (4) collection and summary of the evidence would be a poor use of a
---
guideline panel’s time and resources; and (5) a well-documented, clear and explicit rationale connecting the indirect evidence should be constructed”.25

Notwithstanding the lack of direct evidence supporting the accuracy of the 12L ECG in the diagnosis of chronic heart failure, the Consensus Panel averred that it is still good practice to perform the 12L ECG in the initial evaluation of patients with chronic heart failure in the outpatient setting to determine abnormalities in cardiac structure, function and rhythm to guide management.

These abnormalities identified through an ECG include myocardial ischemia and infarction and arrhythmia. These conditions are addressed in specific guidelines such as guidelines on ST-elevation MI and NonST-elevation MI, or guidelines on Atrial fibrillation, the comprehensive care of which is beyond the scope of the heart failure guidelines.

# 4. Among adult Filipinos presenting with signs and symptoms of chronic heart failure at the outpatient clinic, how accurate is the 2D echocardiogram for the diagnosis of heart failure?

# CONSIDERATIONS

The consensus panel considered the following when formulating these recommendations:

- There are regions in which echocardiograms are unavailable but efforts are being undertaken to improve their availability in the country.
- The CP gave a strong recommendation despite low certainty of evidence because 2D echocardiogram with doppler studies can determine systolic and diastolic function and currently the diagnosis of HF is now echocardiogram-centric.
- Aside from the ejection fraction, 2D echocardiogram can also identify the underlying etiology of HF (i.e. valvular disease, other structural abnormalities) which will help direct management, thus it is considered as a very useful test for heart failure.

# KEY FINDINGS

This evidence summary is based on two meta-analyses and three cohort studies which determined the accuracy of using echocardiographic measures of elevated left ventricular filling pressures (LVFP) in the diagnosis of heart failure.

Pooled analysis based on the three cohort studies showed that echocardiographic measures of increased left ventricular filling pressures (LVFP) have a sensitivity of 0.63 (CI 0.378-0.828) and a specificity of 0.89 (CI 0.819-0.93) in diagnosing elevated LVFP, a surrogate indicator of heart failure. Subgroup analysis of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) showed that echocardiography has a sensitivity of 0.76 (CI 0.61-0.859) and a specificity of 0.70 (CI 0.485-0.847).
---
One meta-analysis showed that the sensitivity and specificity of Tissue Doppler Imaging has a wide confidence interval, significant heterogeneity, and poor correlation (r=<0.5) for the diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Another meta-analysis showed a statistically significant association (pooled correlation coefficient overall was r = 0.69 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63–0.75, P < 0.01]) between invasive hemodynamic assessment and echocardiographic methods of LVFP assessment. Results are more significant in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) as compared to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

# INTRODUCTION

Congestive heart failure is one of the most important public health problems worldwide. It is a complex clinical syndrome with symptoms and signs that result from any structural or functional impairment of ventricular filling or ejection of blood. This condition can be classified as HF with reduced EF (HFrEF) in patients with EF ≤40%, HF with preserved EF (HFpEF) in patient with EF ≥50%, or HF with mildly reduced EF (HFmrEF). Ejection Fraction is important in the classification of HF because of differing prognoses. According to the ASIAN-HF registry, the one-year crude all-cause mortality rate was 9.6% for the entire population with heart failure, but mortality was greater among patients with HFrEF (10.6%) as compared to those with HFpEF (5.4%).

The main pathophysiological process in heart failure (HF) is elevation of intracardiac pressures. This is associated with increased left ventricular filling pressure (LVFP) or left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) caused by either systolic or diastolic impairment of left ventricle (LV) function, which has been proven to be a strong predictor of mortality. Measurement of the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure with the Swan-Ganz catheter has become the gold standard for determining LV filling pressure.

An echocardiogram is an ultrasound scan that evaluates the structure and function of the heart and the adjacent major vessels; a two-dimensional echocardiogram provides longitudinal and cross-sectional views of the chambers of the beating heart and great vessels that enter and exit from the heart. Echocardiograms are performed by placing an ultrasound transducer over the chest of the patient and directing it towards the heart. Echocardiography is one of the most readily available non-invasive diagnostic modalities that can assess LV systolic function. Aside from determining the LVEF, echocardiography also provides information on other parameters such as cardiac chamber size, regional wall motion abnormalities, right ventricular function, pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery pressure), valvular function, and markers of diastolic function.

# REVIEW METHODS

A systematic search was done until December 31, 2022 using Pubmed, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar with a combined MeSH and free text search using the terms “congestive heart failure”, “chronic heart failure”, “diagnosis”, “diagnostic accuracy”, “accuracy”, “echocardiogram”, “transthoracic echocardiogram”, and “2d echocardiogram”.

Only studies (systematic reviews, meta-analyses, cohorts) that used echocardiography and compared it to invasive measurements of elevated LV filling pressure in the diagnosis of heart failure among adult patients were included in this review. Outcomes of interest included diagnostic accuracy parameters (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value).

# RESULTS

# Characteristics of included studies

Two systematic reviews and meta-analyses investigated the accuracy of echocardiographic measures of increased Left Ventricular Filling Pressures (LVFP) in the diagnosis of heart failure. Both were found to be valid using AMSTAR 2.

A systematic review and meta-analysis by Sharifov et al. evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of Tissue Doppler Index (TDI) in estimating left ventricular filling pressure (LVFP) and diastolic dysfunction in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). This study included 24 original clinical studies which compared echocardiographic measures of elevated LVFP using TDI (E/e’ septal, E/e’ lateral, E/e’ mean) with the gold standard—invasive LVFP measurements such as LV end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). Only studies with HFrEF patients included in the analysis were included in this review. Studies on HFpEF were not appraised since this did not answer our clinical question.

Another systematic review and meta-analysis by Jones et al. evaluated the accuracy of different echocardiographic measures of LVFP compared with invasive hemodynamic studies in the diagnosis of heart failure. The study included 27 studies with 2,058 patients which used invasive hemodynamic studies as the gold standard. Among the 27 studies included in the meta-analysis, eight focused on patients with HFrEF, eleven included patients with HFpEF, and another eleven used a heterogeneous population.

A study by Lancelloti et al. compared the diagnostic accuracy of the 2009 and 2016 echocardiographic grading algorithms for predicting invasively measured left ventricular filling pressure. The study included 159 patients undergoing clinically indicated
---
# Coronary Angiography

The study participants included patients with HF with reduced EF (25%) and patients with NYHA ≥ II (64%).

# Diagnostic Accuracy Studies

Another study by Andersen et al. also evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of comprehensive echocardiography in identifying patients with elevated LV filling pressure.9 The study included 450 patients referred for right or left heart catheterization. LVEF was <50% in 209 of 450 patients (46.4%) with a mean LVEF of 47%.

A study by Balaney et al. studied the accuracy of the 2016 American Society of Echocardiography (ASE)/European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (EACVI) guidelines for echocardiographic evaluation of LV diastolic function against invasively measured LV filling pressures using right heart catheterization and compared it with the accuracy of the 2009 guidelines.10 The study included 90 patients who were referred for clinically indicated left heart catheterization and underwent transthoracic echocardiography prior to the procedure. The reference standard was increased invasive LV preatrial contraction (pre-A) pressure measurements defined as >12 mm Hg.

# Efficacy Outcomes

In the systematic review and meta-analysis by Sharifov et al., the summary data for the diagnostic accuracy of TDI E/e (lateral, mean and septal) to identify elevated LVFP showed low sensitivity ranging from 0.25-0.37 and high specificity ranging from 0.91-0.98 with wide confidence intervals and significant heterogeneity6 (Annex 6, Appendix V, Figure 1). Only the E/e septal had a sufficiently high positive likelihood ratio (LR+12) in identifying elevated LVFP. The LR+ for E/e lateral and E/e mean were both low (3.8 and 4.1, respectively). Results of the meta-analysis showed that in random-effects models, TDI E/e had poor to mediocre linear correlation with LVFP (r=<0.5) (Annex 6, Appendix V, Figure 2).

In the meta-analysis of Jones et al., results showed a statistically significant association between invasive hemodynamic assessment and echocardiographic methods of LVFP assessment.7 The pooled correlation coefficient overall was r = 0.69 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63–0.75, P < 0.01] (Annex 6, Appendix V, Figure 3). Analysis of cohort showed that different disease states have varying correlation coefficients with HFrEF showing a higher correlation coefficient (r = 0.67, 95% CI 0.61–0.72) compared with that of HFpEF (r = 0.59, 95% CI 0.53–0.64) (Annex 6, Appendix V, Figure 4 and Figure 5). However, there was also significant heterogeneity in both the quality of the studies and their findings due to inclusion of a heterogenous population.

Pooled analysis of the three cohort studies (Lancelloti, Andersen and Balaney) showed that echocardiography using the 2016 ASE/EACVI guidelines had a sensitivity of 0.63 (CI 0.378-0.828), a specificity of 0.89 (CI 0.819-0.93), a LR+ of 5.5, and a LR- of 0.41 in

# Diagnosing Elevated LVFP

(Annex 6, Appendix V, Figure 6-A). Subgroup analysis of patients with HFrEF showed that echocardiography had a sensitivity of 0.76 (CI 0.61-0.859), a specificity of 0.70 (CI 0.485-0.847), a LR+ of 2.5 and a LR- of 0.35 (Annex 6, Appendix V, Figure 6-B).

# Safety Outcomes

There are no studies which directly showed evidence that performing echocardiography reduces the risk of poor outcomes from heart failure. There is also no direct evidence that shows that performing echocardiography resulted in harm.

# Certainty of Evidence

The two meta-analyses included in this review were assessed to be of moderate quality using the AMSTAR2 critical appraisal tool; neither of the meta-analyses performed graphical or statistical tests for publication bias. Both meta-analyses were also downgraded to low certainty because of significant heterogeneity in both the quality of the studies and their findings due to a heterogenous population. Meanwhile, the systematic review and meta-analysis by Sharifov et al.6 was downgraded to very low certainty due to its indirectness since it only included patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

The certainty of evidence of the three cohort studies included in the review was considered low due to their indirectness (all three studies included patients with or without heart failure who were admitted for clinically indicated left or right heart catheterization) and imprecision (all three had small sample sizes).

# Recommendations from Other Groups

|Group|Recommendation|Strength of recommendation and certainty of evidence|
|---|---|---|
|ACC/AHA 2022|In patients with suspected or newly diagnosed HF, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) should be performed during initial evaluation to assess cardiac structure and function.|IC-LD|
---
# ESC 2021

Echocardiography is recommended as the key investigation for the assessment of cardiac function and of the LVEF. Echocardiography also provides information on other parameters such as chamber size, eccentric or concentric LVH, regional wall motion abnormalities (that may suggest underlying CAD, Takotsubo syndrome, or myocarditis), RV function, pulmonary hypertension, valvular function, and markers of diastolic function.

# NICE 2018

Studies which used echocardiography as the reference standard which was included in the 2010 update have been excluded within the current update as the committee agreed that echocardiography was not an appropriate reference standard for the diagnosis of heart failure.

1. Because very high levels of NT-proBNP suggest poor prognosis, refer people with suspected heart failure and an NT-proBNP level above 2,000 ng/litre (236 pmol/litre) urgently to obtain specialist assessment and transthoracic echocardiography within two weeks.
2. Refer people with suspected heart failure and an NT-pro BNP level between 400 and 2,000 ng/litre (47 to 236 pmol/litre) to obtain specialist assessment and transthoracic echocardiography within six weeks.
3. Perform transthoracic echocardiography to exclude important valve disease, assess the systolic (and diastolic) function of the (left) ventricle, and detect intracardiac shunts.

# Australian 2018

A transthoracic echocardiogram is recommended in patients with suspected heart failure to improve diagnostic accuracy as well as in patients with a new diagnosis of heart failure to assess cardiac structure and function (including the measurement of LV ejection fraction [LVEF]), assist in classification, and, therefore, guide management.

Strong recommendation
FOR-Low quality of evidence

# Malaysian 2019

To confirm the diagnosis and to determine the type of HF and its aetiology, the following should be performed: an echocardiogram to help determine the type of HF (HFrEF, HFmrEF or HFpEF) and identify structural cardiac defects.

# JCS 2017

Perform echocardiography to assess cardiac function, left ventricular wall motion, valvular disease, right ventricular function, and pulmonary hypertension in patients suspected of having heart failure.
---
# Canadian 2017

We recommend that echocardiography be performed in all patients with suspected HF to assess cardiac structure and function, to quantify systolic function for planning and monitoring of treatment, and to perform prognostic stratification.

# ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR EVIDENCE TO DECISION (EtD) PHASE

# COST

The reviewer did not encounter studies on the cost-effectiveness of using echocardiography to diagnose HF in the Philippines. The cost of performing 2D Echocardiography with Doppler Studies in the different government and private hospitals in Manila and Laguna is between Php 3,000 and Php 5,000.

# PATIENT’S VALUES AND PREFERENCE, EQUITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND FEASIBILITY

Echocardiography is non-invasive and available in most secondary and tertiary hospitals, as well as in most diagnostic centers in the country. According to the PHIL-SCREEN study by Magno et al., as of 2021, the Philippines has at least 651 physician echocardiographers, 2,487 cardiac sonographers, and 539 cardiac laboratories. Based on the surveys, the majority of cardiac laboratories where echocardiograms are performed are located in the National Capital Region (28.7%), followed by Region 4A Calabarzon (17.8%), and Region 3 Central Luzon (15.9%). In comparison, according to the Philippine Society of Cardiac Catheterization and Intervention (PSCCI), as of 2022, there are only 55 cardiac catheterization laboratories in the country that can perform the invasive procedures that are considered as the gold standard in diagnosing elevated LVFP.

# OTHER STUDIES

Other forms of cardiac imaging such as the Point of Care Ultrasonography or POCUS echo that is done at the bedside have been studied on patients presenting with signs and symptoms of Acute Heart Failure in the emergency room. Studies on its benefits and accuracy in diagnosing patients with chronic heart failure will be beneficial especially for Filipinos living in the far-flung areas of the country where there are no available 2D echocardiograms with doppler studies.

# 5. Among adult Filipinos presenting with signs and symptoms of chronic heart failure at the outpatient clinic, how accurate are cardiac biomarkers (BNP, NT-pro BNP) for the diagnosis of heart failure?

# CONSIDERATIONS

The consensus panel considered the following when formulating these recommendations:

- Availability of point of care testing in the locality
- The use of BNP or NTproBNP not only to diagnose but to rule out HF in patients with unexplained dyspnea

# KEY FINDINGS

In the systematic review by Taylor et al.,3 42 publications of 39 individual studies met the inclusion criteria and 37 studies were included in the analysis. Of these, 30 studies evaluated BNP POCT and seven studies evaluated NT proBNP. Fifteen (15) studies were done in an ambulatory care setting with low prevalence of chronic HF. Five studies were done in primary care settings.

- At thresholds of more than 100 pg/mL, the pooled sensitivity of BNP, measured with the point-of-care index device Triage, was generally high at 0.95 (95% confidence interval 0.90 to 0.98) at 100 pg/mL and had a pooled specificity of 0.56 (0.39-0.60).
- At thresholds of less than 100 pg/mL, the sensitivity ranged from 0.46 to 0.97 while the specificity ranged from 0.31 to 0.98. BNP was measured with the point-of-care index device Triage.

# Subgroup analysis of patients presenting with dyspnea alone

In Worster et al.,4 4,338 studies were screened and 9 studies were included in the analysis. BNP and NT pro-BNP at thresholds of more than 100 and 400 pg/mL, respectively, were determined at an ambulatory care setting using POCT. The use of BNP had a sensitivity of 0.94 (0.87-0.98) and a specificity of 0.94 (0.89-0.97). Meanwhile, the use of NT pro-BNP had a sensitivity of 0.96 (0.89-0.99) and a specificity of 0.73 (0.45 – 0.92).

In McCullough et al.,5 1,586 patients presenting with dyspnea were included in the study. BNP levels at a threshold of more than 100 pg/ml were determined in primary and ambulatory care settings by POCT and had a sensitivity of 0.90 (0.86–0.93) and a specificity of 0.73 (0.64 – 0.81).

# INTRODUCTION:

Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a member of a family of four human natriuretic peptides that share a common 17-peptide ring structure. The first was identified in 1983 and was named atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). ANP is a 28-amino acid polypeptide resulting from the C-terminal end of the prohormone pro-ANP. ANP is largely produced in the cardiac atria, and is quickly secreted in response to atrial stretching. Normal hearts secrete extremely small amounts of ANP but elevated levels are found in patients with left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and mitral valve disease. After proBNP is secreted in response to volume overload and the resulting myocardial stretch, it is cleaved into the 76-peptide, biologically inert N-terminal fragment NT-proBNP and the 32-peptide, biologically active hormone BNP. The two fragments are secreted into the plasma in equimolar amounts and have both been clinically evaluated for use in the management of congestive heart failure (CHF). High ventricular filling pressures stimulate the release of ANP and BNP. Both peptides have diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects which they exert by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. They also have systemic and renal sympathetic activity. In addition, BNP may also provide a protective effect against the detrimental fibrosis and remodeling that occurs in progressive heart failure.1
---
# Natriuretic peptide receptors and plasma endopeptidases actively clear BNP from circulation

As such, the plasma half-life of BNP is short at approximately 20 minutes. Meanwhile, no receptor-mediated clearance of NT-proBNP is known to occur. As such, NT-proBNP has a correspondingly prolonged half-life of 60-120 minutes. As a result, plasma levels of NT-proBNP tend to be three to five times higher than BNP levels. Clearance of NT-proBNP is thought to be primarily renal. Therefore, the renal clearance of NT-proBNP confounds its diagnostic utility in patients with renal insufficiency.1

As a laboratory specimen, NT-proBNP is more stable during storage than BNP. NT-proBNP samples are stable at room temperature for 72 hours, in contrast to BNP samples which are stable at room temperature for less than 4 hours.2

# Reference Range

The reference values of brain-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal (NT) proBNP are different to exclude or confirm a diagnosis of heart failure. These values also depend on age and gender and are higher in elderly persons and women.

# Normal findings are as follows

- BNP: &lt; 100 pg/mL
- NT-proBNP: &lt; 300 pg/mL

# Critical values

- BNP
- BNP &gt; 400 pg/mL (heart failure likely)
- BNP &gt; 100 pg/mL (NICE and ESC consensus)
- NT-proBNP
- NT-proBNP &gt; 400 pg/mL (NICE and ESC consensus)

# REVIEW METHODS

A systematic search was done from the date of the last search, January 15, until February 3, 2023 using Medline and Google Scholar with a combined MeSH and free text search using the terms “chronic congestive heart failure”, “accuracy of BNP and NT proBNP”, “POCT”, “diagnosis”, “ambulatory care”, “primary care”, and “outpatient department”.
---
● Only cross-sectional and cohort studies that used BNP and NT-proBNP as index tests and a combination of clinical, radiologic (including 2D echocardiography), and various laboratory tests as reference standard were included in the review. Measures of accuracy such as sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and likelihood ratios were considered as outcome measures. No limits were placed on age, sex, race, or severity of illness. However, limits regarding the setting in which the tests were performed were observed—the tests must have been done only in an ambulatory care/outpatient setting using a point-of-care platform—and the studies must have only been conducted in the last 10 years.

● The risk of bias of the individual studies was evaluated using the QUADAS risk of bias assessment.

# RESULTS:

# CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES

The Medline search yielded one result while the free search using Google Scholar yielded 5,940 results. Out of these hits, two systematic reviews and one cross-sectional study were retrieved and appraised. Two systematic reviews by Taylor et al.,3 Worster et al.,4 and an observational study by McCullough5 were used in this review.

In the systematic review by Taylor et al.,3 42 publications of 39 individual studies met the inclusion criteria and 37 studies were included in the analysis. Thirty studies evaluated BNP POCT and seven studies evaluated NT-proBNP. Fifteen studies were conducted in an ambulatory care setting with low prevalence of chronic HF. Meanwhile, five studies were conducted in primary care settings. Reference tests included clinical assessment with retrospective review by one or more doctors (which was usually a cardiologist) and echocardiography.

The population included all adults with the following presentations: Dyspnea (15 studies); Several CHF symptoms (6 studies); Echocardiography referrals (5 studies); CV risk factors (2 studies); Cardiac rehab referral with stable CHF (2 studies); Acute coronary embolism (1 study); and Non-cardiac on mechanical ventilator (1 study).

The prevalence of the condition ranged from 19% to 44% in a primary care setting and was below 50% in an acute care setting. In the primary care setting, two studies assessed BNP and the results ranged from 5.1 to 412 pg/ml. Meanwhile, three studies assessed NT pro-BNP with results ranging from 117 to 1000 pg/mL.
---
The reference standard used across all studies included clinical assessment and retrospective review of diagnosis by one or more doctors (usually a cardiologist), and a 2D echocardiogram.

# Subgroup analysis of patients presenting with dyspnea alone:

In Worster et al.,4 4,338 studies were screened and nine studies were included in the analysis. BNP and NT-proBNP at thresholds of more than 100 pg/mL and 400 pg/mL, respectively, were determined at an ambulatory care setting using POCT.

In McCullough et al.,5 1,586 patients presenting with dyspnea were included in the study and BNP levels at a threshold of more than 100 pg/ml were determined in a primary and ambulatory care setting using POCT.

# EFFICACY OUTCOMES:

In a systematic review by Taylor et al.,3 the results are as follows:

1. At thresholds of &lt;100 pg/mL, sensitivity ranged from 0.46 (95% confidence interval 0.32 to 0.61) to 0.98 (0.93 to 1.00) while specificity ranged from 0.31 (0.22 to 0.41) to 0.98 (0.95 to 1.00). The two studies in primary care settings reported sensitivities ranging from 0.46 (0.32 to 0.61) to 0.92 (0.81 to 0.98) and specificities ranging from 0.38 (0.31 to 0.46) to 0.82 (0.79 to 0.85) at a range of thresholds &lt;100 pg/mL (10-50 ng/mL).
2. Pooled data at thresholds recommended by the ESC7,8 and the NICE guidelines10 for studies in ambulatory care settings with a low prevalence of CHF showed that the sensitivity of BNP was highest at 100 pg/mL, as recommended by NICE10 in all settings. Meanwhile, the use of BNP as recommended by ESC for acute settings had a pooled sensitivity of 0.95 (95% confidence interval 0.90 to 0.98) and a pooled specificity 0.64 (0.46 to 0.78). This was based on seven studies in emergency settings with a prevalence of CHF between 20% and 48%.
3. In studies done in ambulatory care settings with a cross-sectional/cohort design and a threshold of 125 pg/mL, as recommended by the ESC7,8 for non-acute settings, the paired sensitivity and specificity plots for the Cardiac Reader test showed high sensitivity pooled sensitivity (0.99) (95% confidence interval 0.57 to 1.00), moderate specificity (pooled specificity 0.60 (0.44 to 0.74)), and increased specificity at higher thresholds, based on three primary care studies. At 400 pg/mL, the threshold recommended by NICE10, sensitivity ranged from 0.59 (0.49 to 0.68) to 0.88 (0.77 to 0.96) while specificity ranged from 0.79 (0.73 to 0.84) to 0.90 (0.84 to 0.94) in the two studies conducted in a primary care setting.

# Subgroup analysis of patients presenting with dyspnea alone:

In Worster et al.,4 4,338 studies were screened and nine studies were included in the analysis. BNP and NT-proBNP at thresholds of more than 100 pg/mL and 400 pg/mL, respectively, were determined at an ambulatory care setting using POCT. The results showed that the use of BNP had a sensitivity 0.94 (0.87-0.98) and a specificity 0.94 (0.89-0.97), while the use of NT-proBNP had a sensitivity of 0.96 (0.89-0.99) and a specificity of 0.73 (0.45 – 0.92).

In McCullough et al.,5 1,586 patients presenting with dyspnea were included in the study. BNP levels at a threshold of more than 100 pg/mL were determined in primary and ambulatory care settings through POCT. The results revealed a sensitivity of 0.90 (0.86–0.93) and a specificity of 0.73 (0.64–0.81).

Despite the high sensitivity and moderate specificity at different cut-off thresholds, serious risks of biases were seen in the study, such as:

1. Setting the cut-off at pre-specified values – it is also unclear if the studies followed the prescribed thresholds.
2. Issues regarding blinding – it is unsure if the interpreter of the index test was truly unaware of the results of the reference standards.
3. The issue of different reported accuracies with different POCT brands, the low prevalence of the condition in the ambulatory care setting, as well as the scarcity of studies with only a few studies having analyzed NT-proBNP.

It was due to these serious methodological issues that the certainty of evidence was downgraded to low certainty. It is therefore not recommended for routine testing in the outpatient setting as a stand alone test.

# CERTAINTY OF EVIDENCE:

The certainty of evidence of the systematic review by Taylor et al.3 included in this review was evaluated using GRADEPRO and was assessed to be low because of the following reasons:

1. Setting the cut-off at pre-specified values. It is also unclear if the studies actually followed the prescribed thresholds.
2. Building issues; it is uncertain if the interpreter of the index test was truly unaware of the results of the reference standards.
---
3. Different accuracies were reported among the different POCT brands. The prevalence of the condition was also low in an ambulatory care setting. Only a handful of studies have analyzed the use of NT-proBNP.

# RECOMMENDATIONS FROM OTHER GROUPS

---
Patients with NT-proBNP between 400 to 2000 pg/mL should be referred to a specialist and must undergo echocardiography within 6 weeks.

# ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR EVIDENCE TO DECISION (ETD) PHASE

# COST

The cost of testing for NT-pro BNP ranges from 3,000 to 4500 pesos. Point of care testing costs around 2,000 pesos.

The reviewer did not encounter local studies on the financial impact of testing. However, some studies conducted in Sweden have shown that sequential testing can reduce costs for a negative NT-proBNP result (rule-out), and that it could be compared with the cost of echocardiography. These studies have also shown that a strict sequential testing strategy that minimizes the demand for echocardiography could potentially save two to three euros per capita per year. By strictly implementing this simple screening strategy, the health care system could potentially save as much as 19 to 28 million euros per year. As to whether such a strategy would be applicable to the Philippine setting has yet to be validated through real-world data and research.

# PATIENT’S VALUES AND PREFERENCE, EQUITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND FEASIBILITY

# Equity

The cost of testing is the primary concern. Furthermore, the test is only available in big healthcare facilities in urbanized areas making it less accessible to those who live in remote rural areas.

A point of care platform for the test is available and remains a good option for fully automated analyzers.

# Feasibility

The test is readily available in most big healthcare institutions that use expensive, fully-automated analyzers. As such, access is a challenge for healthcare facilities with low resources.

# 6. Among adult Filipinos diagnosed with chronic heart failure at the outpatient clinic, what is the effect of baseline determination of serum electrolytes and creatinine on cardiovascular mortality, heart failure-related hospitalization, and quality of life?

# CONSIDERATIONS

The consensus panel considered the following when formulating these recommendations:

- The CP gave a strong recommendation despite low certainty of evidence for performing laboratory examinations for kidney function, serum sodium and potassium levels because these tests are needed prior to starting treatment to determine the presence of contraindications to the use of pharmacologic therapy.
- Physicians need to determine baseline serum creatinine and electrolytes since the treatment and management of chronic heart failure is continuous. These laboratory examinations can also be used to monitor the adverse effects of treatment and treatment response.

# KEY FINDINGS

# Cohort Studies

Four cohort studies2,3,4,5 included in the de novo meta-analysis showed a pooled RR of 1.46 (95% CI 1.32 – 1.62, p &lt;0.00001) for mortality among patients diagnosed with chronic heart failure at the outpatient clinic with a baseline serum sodium of &lt;135 mEq/L (Hyponatremia).
---
One cohort study6 showed a RR of 1.09 (95% CI 1.05 – 1.14, p &lt;0.0001) for mortality among patients diagnosed with chronic heart failure at the outpatient clinic with a baseline serum sodium of &gt;145 mEq/L (Hypernatremia).

Two cohort studies7,8 included in the de novo meta-analysis showed a pooled RR of 1.16 (95% CI 1.07 – 1.25, p&lt;0.0003) for mortality among patients diagnosed with chronic heart failure at the outpatient clinic with a baseline serum potassium of &lt;4 mEq/L (Hypokalemia).

One cohort study9 showed a RR of 1.67 (95% CI 1.48 – 1.89, p &lt;0.00001) for mortality among patients diagnosed with chronic heart failure at the outpatient clinic with a baseline serum potassium of &gt;5 mEq/L (Hyperkalemia).

Two cohort studies10,11 included in the de novo meta-analysis showed a pooled RR of 1.89 (95% CI 1.67–2.14 p&lt;0.00001) for mortality among patients diagnosed with chronic heart failure at the outpatient clinic with a baseline serum creatinine of &gt;1.2 mg/dL.

# INTRODUCTION

The physiologic actions of the heart and kidneys are so tightly intertwined that any disturbance in one can have an impact on the action of the other. The preload of the heart depends on the sodium and water homeostasis of the kidneys, while the kidney depends on the adequate contraction and relaxation of the heart to maintain renal blood flow. This normal physiology becomes impacted by congestive heart failure, which initially leads to electrolyte imbalance and, eventually, to kidney dysfunction. Several pathophysiologic mechanisms are involved in this derangement such as the reduction of renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, the activation of the renin-angiotensin II-aldosterone axis, the elevation of arginine vasopressin levels, the enhancement of sympathetic nervous system tone, catecholamine release, and other factors. Kidney dysfunction and electrolyte imbalances may also have an arrhythmogenic effect on diseased myocardium.14

Chronic kidney disease, defined as the presence of a glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or of albuminuria, is present in 4.5% of the general population and afflicts about 50% of patients with heart failure. The normal range of serum creatinine is 0.7 – 1.2 mg/dL for men, and 0.6 – 1.1 mg/dL for women. Renal impairment is defined as a serum creatinine level greater than 1.0 mg/dl, creatinine clearance or estimated GFR less than 60 ml/min/1.73m2. Renal dysfunction is extremely common in patients with chronic heart failure.7 The presence of CKD is associated with doubling the risk of all-cause mortality and is a stronger predictor of adverse outcomes.

Dynamic changes in kidney function have also been recognized to cause poorer prognosis.

# Electrolyte Derangements in Chronic Heart Failure

Low serum sodium (hyponatremia), low serum potassium (hypokalemia), and low serum magnesium (hypomagnesemia) are the most common electrolyte derangements in chronic heart failure. Although these conditions are usually seen in patients with more advanced and refractory stages, they can also be seen in mild or compensated heart failure in the presence of therapy-related complications, particularly in the excessive use of diuretics. Hyponatremia is defined as a serum sodium concentration of less than 135 mEq/L but may vary to some extent depending on the set values of various laboratories. Hypernatremia is defined as a serum sodium concentration of greater than 145 mEq/L. Serum potassium is maintained between 3.5 and 5.3 mmol/L by renal excretion and by shifts between cellular compartments. Hypokalemia is a strong independent predictor of mortality in heart failure because of its arrhythmogenic property. These electrolyte imbalances are of vast clinical importance because they not only represent an immediate risk to the patient with chronic heart failure, but also can lead to an unfavorable clinical course and an adverse therapeutic response. The optimal care of the chronic heart failure patient includes the recognition and management of these serum electrolyte disturbances.

# Review Methods

The initial approach for this clinical question was to use the serum electrolyte abnormalities as a screening tool for congestive heart failure. Upon searching the literature for answers, however, the evidence reviewers found that their search yielded negative results for the use of electrolyte abnormalities as a screening tool for heart failure. The studies encountered during the initial search yielded studies regarding electrolyte abnormalities and their association to outcomes among patients with congestive heart failure. Thus, it was recommended by the steering committee that the clinical question be of prognostic value, with each serum electrolyte abnormality associated with a disease outcome–cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization, and quality of life.

A systematic search was done on electronic databases (Medline, Google Scholar, HERDIN Plus, and Cochrane Database for Systematic Reviews) between November and March 2023.

# RESULTS

# Characteristics of the included studies

We were able to identify four cohort studies for hyponatremia, two cohort studies for hypokalemia, and two cohort studies for elevated serum creatinine in answering the dilemma of determining prognosis among chronic heart failure patients. We could only find one study each for hypernatremia and hyperkalemia. All of the studies were cohort studies, mostly retrospective with a few prospective studies. Patients were monitored based on their measured serum electrolyte levels and were compared to patients with the same condition albeit with normal serum electrolyte levels (See Tables 32-35).

# Efficacy Outcomes

Impact of Serum sodium levels on Mortality

Based on the four cohort studies, serum sodium (Na) levels of < 135 mmol/L are associated with a significant risk for overall mortality (RR = 1.46, 95% CI 1.34-1.59) compared to chronic heart failure patients with normal serum sodium levels. The results verified that the lower the serum sodium level, the higher the risk for mortality in several observational studies. We could only find one cohort study for hypernatremia (> 145 mmol/L) and it showed a significant risk for overall mortality (RR= 1.09, 95% CI 1.05-1.14).
---
# Impact of Serum potassium levels in Mortality

Two cohort studies were used in the outcomes, and low serum potassium (K) levels of &lt; 3.5 mEq/L were associated with an increased overall mortality (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.05-1.14) compared to chronic heart failure patients with normal levels of potassium. Chronic heart failure patients seen at the OPD with a baseline serum potassium of &gt; 5 mEq/L are 1.7 times more likely to die as compared to chronic heart failure patients with normal baseline serum potassium.

# Impact of Elevated Serum creatinine in Mortality

Two cohort studies were used to gauge overall mortality in chronic heart failure patients. The studies showed that patients with elevated serum creatinine levels of &gt; 1.2 mg/dL have a higher risk of overall mortality (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.67-2.14) compared to chronic heart failure patients with normal serum creatinine levels. Chronic heart failure patients seen at the OPD with a baseline serum creatinine of &gt; 1.2 mg/dl are 1.89 times more likely to die as compared to chronic heart failure patients with normal baseline serum creatinine.

# Certainty of Evidence

Among the studies found for each electrolyte abnormality, the risk of bias was downgraded to serious because all of them had a risk of bias (retrospective cohorts) and thus, the certainty of evidence was very low.

# RECOMMENDATIONS FROM OTHER GROUPS

The European Society of Cardiology has recommended a better understanding of serum electrolytes and cardio-renal interactions in heart failure because misinterpretation of the tests could lead to insufficient dosing of the guideline-directed medical therapy, failure to attain decongestion, and worsening of heart failure.

# PATIENT’S VALUES AND PREFERENCE, EQUITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND FEASIBILITY

The reviewer did not encounter local studies on patients’ values and preferences regarding the effect of baseline serum electrolytes (sodium and potassium) and serum creatinine on mortality among patients with chronic heart failure.

Likewise, there are no studies regarding the impact on health equity of determining the baseline serum electrolytes (sodium and potassium) and serum creatinine on mortality among patients with chronic heart failure.

Serum electrolytes and creatinine are readily available in outpatient diagnostic clinics and in the laboratory sections or pathology departments of government and private hospitals in the country.

Thiazide/loop diuretics and RAAS blockers are associated with dyskalemia and spironolactone is associated with hyperkalemia.

Thiazide/loop diuretics, ACE-I and spironolactone are associated with hyponatremia.

ACE-Is are associated with elevated creatinine (worsening renal function).

Clinicians should regularly monitor serum sodium, potassium, and creatinine, and treat dyskalemia, especially in chronic heart failure patients with CKD and DM.

# 7. Among adult Filipinos diagnosed with chronic heart failure at the outpatient clinic, what is the effect of nonpharmacologic interventions (dietary sodium and fluid restriction, exercise prescription) on the incidence of cardiovascular mortality, heart failure-related hospitalization, and quality of life?

# CONSIDERATIONS

The consensus panel considered the following when formulating these recommendations:

1. The studies reviewed did not give a specific threshold for sodium restriction but several groups have recommendations regarding sodium intake.
2. In areas where cardiac rehabilitation centers are not available, supervised exercise training is suggested while in areas with cardiac rehabilitation centers, patients should be referred to the rehabilitation facility.
3. Stable heart failure patients are patients whose signs and symptoms are controlled and have remained unchanged for at least one month, and who are able to tolerate guideline-directed medical therapy without red flag signs such as chest pain, fainting, severe weakness, tachycardia, sudden, severe shortness of breath, and coughing with frothy secretions.
4. The patients for whom these recommendations will apply are those in a compensated state with no evidence of congestion and who do not need additional diuretic dose.

# KEY FINDINGS

Five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigated the effect of dietary sodium and/or fluid restriction on the incidence of all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization, as well as on the quality of life in adult Filipinos diagnosed with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction at the outpatient clinic. A meta-analysis provided data on the effect of exercise for the same population.

There is low-quality evidence that sodium and fluid restriction increases the incidence of all-cause death and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction seen at the outpatient clinic. This is from two RCTs, both underpowered for the outcome of mortality.
---
Sodium restriction alone does not affect the incidence of all-cause death in patients with chronic heart failure and low ejection fraction. This is from only one study and the quality of evidence is moderate. There is also low-quality evidence that it does not affect the rate of HF hospitalization for the same population. Reasons for the downgrade of certainty include the variability in methodology of the studies which used different sodium levels, the small number of events, and the sample size.

For quality of life, there is low-quality evidence that sodium restriction with or without fluid restriction may improve quality of life using the KCCQ score in patients with chronic heart failure and low ejection fraction seen at the outpatient clinic. Reasons for the downgrade of certainty include risk of bias from different study methodologies.

One study on fluid restriction alone reported quality of life as an outcome where the median QoL score using MLWHF score was not statistically different between the liberal fluid group and the restricted fluid group.

There was no difference between intervention and control groups for safety end points of changes in systolic blood pressure and creatinine levels.

There is low quality of evidence that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs have no effect on the incidence of all-cause mortality (up to 12-month follow-up) based on a meta-analysis of 27 trials. The review suggests that exercise may decrease rates of hospitalization for heart failure, based on low-quality evidence from 14 trials. There is improved quality of life with exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation but quality of evidence is also low based on a review of 17 trials. Downgrade of certainty of evidence for cardiac rehabilitation was due to the presence of risk of bias due to unspecified allocation concealment and imprecision from the low number of events.

# INTRODUCTION

Heart failure affects more than 64 million people worldwide with health costs amounting to 37 billion US dollars in 2012. Although pharmacologic treatment of heart failure has been dynamic and effective in improving quality of life, the non-pharmacological aspect of treatment remains important. Dietary salt and water restriction have been historically part of heart failure treatment. The perceived poor quality of life from excess fluid and the knowledge of heart failure pathology, wherein sodium and water retention are known to be compensatory mechanisms for preserving cardiac output, have promoted this practice in spite of a lack of evidence regarding its impact on important clinical outcomes. This strategy became controversial when studies that showed that the intervention did not have the expected effect on clinical outcomes began coming out. While there are studies that show the benefit of salt restriction, there is also evidence that sodium restriction may lead to detrimental renal and neurohormonal effects that worsen clinical outcomes.
---
Physical deconditioning in patients with heart failure is believed to be the main cause of the fatigue that stems from decreased nutritive blood flow to the muscles and alterations in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. Exercise rehabilitation has been promoted to counteract this but studies have still been unable to demonstrate a consistent benefit; safety concerns for patients with reduced ejection fraction have also come up with regards to this intervention.

It is therefore important to review the evidence whether non-pharmacologic intervention will benefit patients with heart failure, particularly regarding mortality, hospitalization, and quality of life.

# REVIEW METHODS

A systematic search was done from November to December 2022 using Medline, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar with a combined MeSH and free text search using the terms “chronic heart failure”, “stable heart failure”, “dietary sodium restriction”, “salt restriction”, “fluid restriction”, “mortality”, “hospitalizations”, “admission”, and “quality of life“. Another search was performed using the terms “exercise”, “aerobic exercise”, “rehabilitation”, and “chronic heart failure”. We also looked at the references from the guidelines commonly used in clinical practice. Herdin was also used but no search results were found.

Randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews that compared sodium and/or water restriction against usual care were included in this review. Randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews that compared exercise to no exercise in stable patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction were also included. Outcomes of interest included mortality, hospitalization, and quality of life. No limits were placed on age and year of publication. Articles on decompensated heart failure, preserved ejection fraction, and hospitalized study participants were excluded.

Articles in which sodium and water restriction were used were entered in REVMAN for a de novo meta-analysis using the Cochrane risk of Bias tool. Recommendation regarding the strength of evidence was based on Grading of Recommendations Assessment. The meta-analysis for exercise was found in the Cochrane database and therefore also used GradePro for assessment.

# RESULTS

# Characteristics of included studies for sodium and water restriction

We found five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that included a total of 1,205 patients with chronic heart failure, predominantly with reduced ejection fraction. One RCT had
---
more than 800 study participants, contributing to about 66% of the total population. In the studies that included patients with both preserved and reduced ejection fraction, the majority of the study participants with reduced ejection fraction—at least 65% of the total population—had low ejection fraction.

All included studies had restricted dietary sodium or salt as intervention or exposure versus usual care. The level of sodium restriction varied among the studies. Usual care was routine dietary advice from the physicians with no specified sodium level. Data on hospitalization were obtained for all included studies and only two reported data for mortality rate. One trial reported on quality of life. The follow-up period was also variable among the studies: 84 days, 12 months, and 180 days.

Two studies used salt restriction alone as intervention, two studies used salt restriction with constant water intake, and one study used fluid restriction alone.

# Characteristics of included studies for exercise

We found 1 large RCT and several meta-analyses that looked at exercise training and its impact on mortality and hospitalization.

We based our recommendation on a meta-analysis conducted in 2019 that included 44 trials, mostly on patients with reduced ejection fraction that engaged in physical exercise either at baseline or as part of a rehabilitation program. These studies used one to three sessions per week of aerobic and resistance exercises with a minimum follow-up of six months. The largest RCT which engaged 2,331 participants under this intervention was included in this meta-analysis.

The meta-analysis by Long et al. answered the question of interest regarding the impact of exercise training on mortality, hospitalization, and quality of life. Although it included a few studies that included patients with preserved ejection fraction, the majority of studies included in the meta-analysis was focused on patients with reduced ejection fraction. The review methods were established prior to the conduct of the review. An extensive literature search using at least two databases and trial registries was also conducted. There appears to be some bias for small studies and publication bias but this was declared and addressed by the authors. There was adequate description of the included studies and method of review. Sensitivity analysis was done considering the risk of bias.

# Efficacy outcomes

Dietary restriction of both sodium and fluid resulted in higher rates of hospitalization (2.72, 95% CI 1.39 – 5.31) and death (RR 2.83, 95% CI 1.06 - 7.57). Dietary restriction of sodium alone did not affect rates of hospitalization (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.89-

# 1.57

and death (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.86 1.77).7 For quality of life, there was an improvement of 10.75 in the mean KCCQ scores (9.26 to 12.25) in favor of the treatment group which used sodium and/or fluid restriction.8,9 For fluid restriction alone, there was only one study found where quality of life was reported as an outcome. This was a randomized cross-over study and there was no difference in the median MLWHFQ scores for study participants whether they were in the restricted or the liberal fluid intake intervention. Scores were 20 and 17 respectively.10

Based on the meta-analysis by Long et al.12, cardiac rehabilitation did not make a difference in the incidence of all-cause mortality over the short term (≤ one year of follow-up); 5.1% vs control 5.8%; risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% (CI) 0.66 to 1.21. Cardiac rehabilitation may reduce HF-specific hospitalizations (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.84). Meanwhile, a clinically important improvement in short-term, disease-specific, health-related quality of life using the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure questionnaire was noted, with a mean difference in scores (MD) of -7.11 points, 95% CI -10.49 to -3.7.

# Safety outcomes

Safety endpoints for sodium restriction in the study by Kalogeropoulos included a drop in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of more than 20mmHg and worsening creatinine.9 Only one participant in the 1,500 mg group was withdrawn due to a drop in BP and one participant in the 3,000 mg group had worsening creatinine. The study by Hummel had the same safety endpoints of interest but none showed a significant difference from enrollment to the end of the study.8

For exercise, HF-ACTION, the largest RCT, reports 37 patients in the intervention group and 22 in the control group suffering from events within three hours of the exercise training. Events included angina, arrhythmia, dizziness, and presyncope.11

# Certainty of evidence

For combined sodium and fluid restriction, certainty of evidence for all-cause death is low due to high risk of bias from imprecision as there was only one study that looked into this. For the outcome of hospitalization, certainty of evidence is low. This downgrade was due to very serious imprecision caused by the low number of events and small sample size. Blinding was also an issue due to the intervention that could not be undisclosed to the patient with some crossovers occurring in some studies. The different cut-off levels for sodium content also make it difficult to make conclusions as to the level of restriction that will have an impact on outcomes.
---
If sodium restriction is isolated, certainty of evidence for death rate improves to moderate; however, only one trial has this outcome and is associated with an inconclusive interpretation due to a very wide confidence interval. As for heart failure hospitalization, quality of evidence is low from two trials due to imprecision and indirectness. Indirectness in the studies is caused by the character of their populations which had a mixture of patients with reduced ejection fraction and patients with preserved ejection fraction in one study. Meanwhile, the other study only included patients older than 65 years old.

As for the quality of life outcome, level of evidence was considered moderate. The downgrade was due to a small sample size.

For exercise-based rehabilitation, the certainty of evidence is low for mortality, HF-related hospitalization, and quality of life. The downgrade is due to the risk of bias and imprecision due to the small number of events (n=300). The risk of bias is due to poor reporting of the authors’ generation and concealment of allocation sequence and blinding. Although blinding was not feasible due to the nature of the intervention, the authors still identified some studies to be at high risk. Other sources of bias include the lack of explanation regarding the imbalance in the baseline characteristics between groups in most of the studies. These were also some studies with high dropout rates on which no details were given.

# ONGOING STUDIES

Studies on dietary sodium and fluid restriction remain challenging for patients who are not hospitalized because of the issue of monitoring adherence and the provision of standardized intervention. Large trials are still unavailable though they may help establish whether or not certain non-pharmacologic treatments are necessary for certain subsets of heart failure patients. The optimal amount of sodium and fluid intake are still to be determined.

Several meta-analyses have been written in the past year for sodium restriction in patients with heart failure but due to studies with small sample size, hard data for the subset of patients that are not decompensated and not hospitalized is still inadequate.

FRESH UP is an ongoing randomized controlled open label multicenter trial that is trying to investigate the effect of restricted fluid intake vs liberal fluid intake in stable outpatients with CHF. Recruitment will continue up to 2024 with an estimated enrollment of 506 participants.

# ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR EVIDENCE TO DECISION (EtD) PHASE

# COST

The cost for the intervention of sodium restriction will be from the cost of education and guidance of patients as to how they can adhere to the prescribed sodium amount without sacrificing nutritional content. For exercise, Long et al. cited a cost-effectiveness analysis of long-term moderate exercise training performed by Georgiou and colleagues on patients in stable heart failure seen at the Lancisi Institute in Ancona, Italy. The incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio was USD1773/life‐year saved; factors considered included cost of hospitalization, cost of exercise training, and wages lost from training. The estimated increment in life expectancy with exercise was 1.82 years/person compared with control. In the local setting, at the Philippine Heart Center, an exercise program for heart failure costs Php 16,500 for 16 sessions, 2 sessions per week at the rehabilitation facility of the hospital. The reviewer did not find any economic evaluation studies in the local setting.

# PATIENT’S VALUES AND PREFERENCE, EQUITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND FEASIBILITY

For sodium and water restriction, acceptability will be a challenge since Asian cuisine is high in salt. Sodium and fluid restriction may not be easily acceptable to most patients and self-restriction may not be effective. Reviewed studies used medical staff, a dietician or a third party to facilitate adherence to the sodium limitation while keeping to the required nutrients.4,8,9 Some studies had meals delivered and prepared by a third party.10 In spite of this, adherence to the restriction remained a challenge. Coaching for this diet will require a dietician or other medical staff. Since we are dealing with patients seen in the outpatient clinic, referring patients to a coaching team will surely be a challenge to the attending physician. The study by Kalogeropoulos had only 27 patients because, in spite of having meals delivered to the study participants, only 52% complied with the restriction. A systematic review of dietary sodium restriction trials in 2020 showed that out of the 10 trials and 25 descriptive studies included, dietary sodium was decreased in only seven (7) studies and none of them achieved 1,500 mg/day. The study opined that the failure may be due to non-inclusion of the determinants of successful sodium restriction such as social support, taste preference, food access, and sociocultural norms.15

# 8. Among adult Filipinos diagnosed with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) at the outpatient clinic, what is the effect of diuretics on the incidence of cardiovascular mortality, heart failure-related hospitalization, and quality of life?

# CONSIDERATIONS

The consensus panel considered the following when formulating these recommendations:

- Since the trials included in the evidence review did not give information on the ejection fraction of the patients included in the trials, those included were patients with signs of congestion as per physician discretion and loop diuretics were used. The final recommendation reflected this.
- The CP gave a strong recommendation despite low certainty of evidence for the use of diuretics in patients with heart failure with pulmonary congestion because of the benefits gained in reducing all-cause mortality and relief of signs and symptoms of fluid overload.
- Physicians must be judicious in starting the use of loop diuretics, titrating the dose, and withholding loop diuretics, taking physical examination findings, hemodynamic status, and electrolyte levels into account.

# KEY FINDINGS

There were 14 RCTs in the published meta-analysis that compared the effect of diuretics against placebo or standard of care among patients with chronic heart failure. Only eight studies determined the outcomes regarding all-cause mortality, hospitalization due to worsening heart failure, and exercise tolerance. Quality of life
---
was not assessed among the studies. Six observational studies that indirectly assess the adverse effects of diuretics were likewise evaluated.

- Diuretics were shown to be beneficial in terms of reducing all-cause mortality, hospitalization due to heart failure, and exercise tolerance based on this published meta-analysis. All these RCTs had small sample sizes; the maximum number of participants was 202 for the mortality outcome.
- Adverse events, such as hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and arrhythmia were more frequently observed in the group that received diuretics based on the observational studies.
- All RCTs in the published meta-analysis have issues on allocation concealment. All of these RCTs were done between 1977 to 1994. The published meta-analysis did not assess publication bias. As such, the certainty of evidence for the efficacy outcomes is low. On the other hand, only observational studies were included for the appraisal of the adverse event since these were not included in the published meta-analysis.

# INTRODUCTION

Given the crucial role of congestion in heart failure, diuretics remain to be a cornerstone in heart failure management. Among the therapies for heart failure, diuretics are the only group of drugs with a Class I recommendation in patients with heart failure with reduced, mid-range, or preserved ejection fraction. They are recommended in acute decompensation as well as in chronic heart failure for managing signs and symptoms of congestion. For patients with a history of congestion, a maintenance dose is recommended to prevent the recurrence of symptoms.1 Besides ultrafiltration, the only pathway to get rid of sodium and water related to volume overload and congestion is through natriuresis and diuresis. Different types of diuretics work on different sites in the nephrons and with varying potency, as measured by the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa). Acetazolamide works on the proximal nephron, while loop diuretics work on the ascending loop of Henle. Thiazide-like diuretics work on the early distal convoluted tubules, while mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) work on the distal tubule. Among these diuretics, loop diuretics are the most potent with a FENa of 20-25%. MRAs, on the other hand, are not usually used since they also have a different mode of action on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).1

The use of oral furosemide as diuretic therapy has been “the cornerstone of heart failure therapy for >20 years, before construction of the modern bases of evidence for HF therapies.”2 In fact, more than 80% of the patients enrolled in the randomized clinical trials that have served as the bases for guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) received the background of diuretic therapy to treat and prevent recurrence of

congestion.3 A critique of published heart failure guidelines published in Acta Medica in 2014 elaborated that “baseline HF drug therapy” using diuretics and digoxin is cited in 79-100% of trials on heart failure. In the aforementioned analysis, the authors extrapolated that survival rate on this “baseline HF drug therapy” is 8-51% based on a 38% natural HF survival rate for the time period.4 The introduction of furosemide in the 1960s provided evidence for the use of loop diuretics in treating patients with heart failure. Until then, heart failure was considered a terminal condition. When furosemide was introduced orally and parenterally, there was dramatic resolution of congestive symptoms. As a result, diuretics have been given to heart failure patients because they obviously worked. These agents have not been tested in bigger trials that evaluate their effect on survival because they are already routinely used.5

# RESULTS

# Characteristics of included studies

We used the Cochrane review by Farris et al. which included RCTs on diuretics for chronic heart failure. The Cochrane review included 14 trials (525 participants), of which seven were placebo-controlled. The other seven compared diuretics against other agents such as digoxin or ACE inhibitors. All-cause mortality data was available in three of the placebo-controlled trials, with a total of 202 participants. Data regarding hospitalization for worsening heart failure were available in two trials involving 169 participants. These trials were withdrawal of diuretic studies. There were six cross-over studies and they have stated explicitly that these trials were treated in the same fashion as parallel group studies since there was a washout period and the authors perceived that there were no carry-over effects. The study periods range from 3 weeks to 52 weeks and trial sizes ranged from 10 to 202 participants. More than 85% of participants completed the planned follow-up period. The diuretic drugs and dose regimens used in the studies varied, although loop diuretics were used in the majority of the studies. The mean age of the participants was 59 + 11 years and there was a predominance of males among the study participants. Most of the participants are in NYHA Class II (40%) or III (29%). The choice of outcomes varied from study to study: there were four studies on LV performance; five on symptoms; three on hemodynamic effects; four on exercise capacity and two on the side effects of treatment. None of the studies reported the effect of diuretics on quality of life. Overall, the methodological quality of the studies included in the meta analysis was moderate. Allocation concealment was unclear for all the studies and assessment of outcomes was unclear for only some of them.

Since this meta-analysis did not include safety outcomes such as electrolyte abnormalities, we included six observational studies that were either a retrospective analysis of clinical trials regarding other HF medications or a review of heart failure patient registries.

# Efficacy outcomes

|Hospitalizations due to worsening Heart Failure|2|0.08 [0.01, 0.59]|Favors diuretics|
---
# Exercise Capacity

4 0.72 [0.4, 1.04] Favors diuretics

Table 41 describes the beneficial effects of diuretics on the clinical outcomes of patients with chronic heart failure. Three placebo-controlled trials reported a total of 15 deaths in 202 subjects. Mortality was also lower for those who received diuretics than for those under placebo [(3/101 -vs-12/101), RR 0.28; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.87; p=0.02).5

Two trials on the withdrawal of diuretic use involving 169 subjects reported hospitalization caused by worsening heart failure. The rate of hospitalization was lower for those who received diuretics compared to those under placebo [(0/81-vs-13/88), RR 0.08; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.59; p=0.01).5

No study in this meta-analysis explored the effect of diuretics on quality of life. Instead, exercise capacity was used as a surrogate for quality of life in four RCTs and was then measured to compare the outcome of diuretic use against that of active controls in 91 participants. Diuretics were found to improve exercise capacity in participants with chronic heart failure, WMD 0.72, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.04, p &lt;0.0001.5

# Safety outcomes

There is no data from the meta-analysis regarding the adverse effects of diuretic use in the management of chronic heart failure.5 However, based on its pharmacologic properties, diuretics may have an adverse effect on electrolyte balance, particularly on sodium and potassium.1

A retrospective analysis of the data from the Studies on Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) trial, a trial that compared enalapril and placebo, showed that in patients with EF &lt;36% and who received non-potassium-sparing diuretics, there is an increased risk for arrhythmia-related death (RR 1.78,95% CI 1.47 to 2.13).7 Two observational studies demonstrated that diuretics are associated with hyponatremia (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.14).8,9 Meanwhile, three observational studies, two of which used registry data, showed that diuretics are associated with hypokalemia (RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.49 to 1.65).10,11,12

# Certainty of Evidence

Since the majority of the trials included in the meta analysis were done between the late 70s and the early 90s, there are concerns regarding their methodological quality. Allocation concealment was unclear in all of the studies included in the meta-analysis, while assessment of outcome measures was unclear in some. Publication bias is also suspected for all the efficacy outcomes. Overall certainty of evidence was graded low because of both the serious risks of bias that were noted amongst the critical efficacy outcomes and the small sample size. The Grade Evidence Profile summary is in Annex 10, Appendix C.

# Recommendations from Other Groups

We reviewed the recommendations of the international guidelines that the Philippine medical community usually adopts or adapts (ACC-AHA, ESC, NICE) as well as two guidelines from the Asia-Pacific region (Malaysian and Australian). These international guidelines gave a strong recommendation for the use of diuretics for heart failure patients with congestion. Only the ESC gave a recommendation for the use of diuretics to improve exercise capacity and reduce HF-related hospitalization (Class I Level C). These recommendations were given although the randomized clinical trials.

# ONGOING STUDIES

Optimization of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) has been one of the guiding principles in the management of chronic heart failure patients. These efforts have been shown to improve long-term outcomes, particularly in the use of beta-blockers, RAAS inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. However, there has been little evidence to provide guidance on the optimal dose of loop diuretics.

The strategy for outpatient diuretic management will be evaluated in one pilot study that is to be conducted this 2023. The trial will evaluate whether a fixed diuretic dose or a flexible dosing regimen based on daily weight is more effective in preventing HF-related hospitalization and acute kidney injury for patients with heart failure being seen at ambulatory care facilities.16

With the advent of SGLT-2 inhibitors and Sacubutril-Valsartan, it may also be time to consider doing a “withdrawal trial” on the background of this current GDMT.17 The level of evidence for diuretic use in heart failure will remain low in the absence of a large, randomized clinical trial which has been a necessary proof for guideline development. However, performing a randomized-controlled trial on diuretic use for congestive heart failure may be akin to doing an RCT for parachutes at this point in time.17

The reviewer did not encounter published economic effectiveness studies on diuretics use for heart failure. The prices of diuretic use based on the following assumptions: the local price of furosemide, which is Php. 0.58 to Php 2.50 per 40-mg tablet; four serum potassium determinations per year, pegged at Php 165.00 to Php 400.00 per determination; and four consultations per year at Php 500 to Php 1,000 per consultation.

# PATIENT’S VALUES AND PREFERENCE, EQUITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND FEASIBILITY

There are no specific studies on the equity, acceptability, and feasibility of diuretic use for heart failure. Based on the International Congestive Heart Failure (INTER-CHF) study, around 45% of the South East Asian cohort in the INTER-CHF study was on loop diuretics, making it the third highest heart failure medication that patients received next to ACE-Inhibitor/ARB (73%) and beta blocker (66%).

# 9. Among adult Filipinos diagnosed with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) at the outpatient clinic, what is the effect of beta-blockers on the incidence of cardiovascular mortality, heart failure-related hospitalization, and quality of life?

# CONSIDERATIONS

The consensus panel considered the following when formulating these recommendations:

- There is a wealth of evidence supporting the use of beta-blockers (metoprolol succinate, bisoprolol, carvedilol, nebivolol) in the treatment of HFrEF.

# KEY FINDINGS

Fifteen randomized controlled trials compared the use of beta-blockers on top of standard of care (a diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) in the treatment of stable chronic heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of less than or equal to 40% (HFrEF) with regards to the outcomes of cardiovascular mortality, heart failure-related hospitalization, and safety.

For the outcome on quality of life, one meta-analysis that included 13 studies (some studies are likewise present in the de novo meta-analysis) to examine the same intervention against placebo was included.

Results showed that compared to a placebo, the use of beta-blockers, specifically bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol succinate and nebivolol, on top of standard of care decreased cardiovascular mortality, heart failure mortality, and heart failure-related
---
hospitalization. With regard to the quality of life outcome, there is a trend to benefit from the use of the aforementioned beta-blockers.

The frequency of the adverse events of dizziness, hypotension, and bradycardia were significantly higher among patients with HFrEF who were given beta-blockers compared to placebo. On the other hand, there is a significantly lower incidence of worsening heart failure and malignant ventricular arrhythmias among patients with HFrEF who were given beta-blockers as compared to placebo. The incidence of syncope was similar in both arms.

Most of the studies had a low risk of bias although some trials did not describe how allocation concealment was done. One study had significant drop-out rates. Moreover, heterogeneity was significant when all the beta-blockers with studies on heart failure were included, or when the studies comparing the different dosages of beta-blockers were included. The sensitivity analysis using only bisoprolol, carvedilol, and metoprolol succinate showed no significant heterogeneity. Nevertheless, significant heterogeneity was the reason for downgrading the certainty of evidence for the outcomes of heart failure mortality and heart failure-related hospitalization.

# INTRODUCTION:

In a local study conducted in 2016 using PhilHealth hospitalization claims,1 the prevalence rate for hospitalization due to congestive heart failure was 1.6% or 1,648 cases for every 100,000 patient claims for a medical condition. The burden of the disease in the outpatient setting can only be surmised. Likewise, a study published in 2018 was done to determine the economic burden of heart failure-related hospitalization using PhilHealth data.2 It was found that the price of hospitalization ranged from PhP 19,340 to PhP 28,220 in government hospitals and from PhP 28,370 to PhP 41,800 in private hospitals. These are conservative estimates of the hospitalization costs for patients with congestive heart failure class III using the local setting.

The use of beta-blockers has long been part of the pillars of heart failure management in international clinical practice guidelines because of their effect on cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization, and quality of life. Several beta-blockers—metoprolol tartrate, metoprolol succinate, carvedilol, bisoprolol, bucindolol, atenolol and nebivolol—have been studied with regards to their effect on heart failure. Recent guidelines showed that the beta-blockers with benefits regarding cardiovascular mortality and heart failure-related hospitalization are carvedilol, bisoprolol, and metoprolol succinate. On the other hand, it was also shown that nebivolol is beneficial in reducing composite outcome of death or cardiovascular hospitalization but not in reducing mortality.
---
In a local study done in 2020, it was found that the prescription rate of beta-blockers among patients admitted for heart failure was 56.3%.3 Registry data suggested that the programme had significant impact in improving the rate of use of beta-blockers (from a 34% baseline to a rate of 51% by 2014) to 56.3% by 2018.

Because of the epidemiologic and economic burden of the disease, the importance of optimal management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, or of heart failure with an ejection fraction that was objectively assessed to be less than or equal to 40% in the outpatient setting has been highlighted, hence this undertaking.

# REVIEW METHODS

A comprehensive and systematic search of local and international databases was done from database inception up to December 31, 2022 through MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, HERDIN, Google scholar, and clinicaltrials.gov using the combined MeSH and keywords of the following terms: “heart failure”, “congestive heart failure”,
---
# 2022 that addressed the mentioned outcomes of interest and included all the relevant trials were either individual patient data meta-analysis or a network meta-analysis.

The Cochrane Collaboration tool for the assessment of risk of bias was used to assess the quality of the RCTs included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis was done using Review Manager 5.4. For the meta-analysis on quality of life by Turgeon et al., AMSTAR2 was used to assess risk of bias.

# RESULTS

# Characteristics of included studies

There were fifteen RCTs that included patients with stable symptomatic CHF (of varying etiologies) with an EF of less than or equal to 40% to evaluate the effect of beta-blockers on cardiovascular mortality, heart failure-related hospitalization, quality of life, and safety. Most of the RCTs included had low risk of bias although some of the studies had unclear allocation concealment—something which was not specifically mentioned in older trials. One of the studies done in 1997 had unclear allocation concealment and did not specify how
---
# Hospitalization for heart failure

The pooled analysis of six RCTs14,17,18,20,22,24 for heart failure-related hospitalization showed that compared to placebo, heart failure-related hospitalization was significantly reduced by 23% with the use of bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol succinate (RR 0.73, 95%CI 0.66-0.80, p&lt;0.00001, I=0%, p=0.74) on top of the standard of care at the time.2

# Quality of Life

The meta-analysis by Turgeon et al. on quality of life11 showed that there was no significant difference in the QoL scores (standard mean difference 0.04 (95%CI -0.02 to 0.09, p&lt;0.56, I2=0, p=0.85) with no observed heterogeneity.

Interpretation
*The risk in the intervention group (and its 95% confidence interval) is based on the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its 95% CI).

CI: confidence interval; MD: mean difference; OR: odds ratio; RR: risk ratio

# GRADE Working Group grades of evidence

- High certainty: very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.
- Moderate certainty: moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.
- Low certainty: confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.
- Very low certainty: very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.

# EXPLANATIONS

- a. SENIORS trial has attrition bias
- b. Unclear risk of bias mostly because of insufficient reporting of randomization and allocation concealment for trials published in the 1990s and early 2000s. For the ENECA study, no specific mention of how allocation was concealed [just that a number was allocated to a subject and that number determined whether the patient was given the treatment drug or a placebo].

# Safety Outcomes

Pooled analysis of the RCTs with the reported adverse events showed that:

- dizziness (6 studies, OR 1.90, 95%CI 1.31-2.75, p=0.0007, I2=79%, p=0.0002),
- hypotension (10 studies, OR 1.74, 95%CI 1.08-2.81, p=0.02, I2=68%, p=0.001), and
- bradycardia (9 studies, OR 3.63, 95%CI 1.84-7.18, p=0.0002, I2=74%, p=0.0001) were more frequent among patients taking a beta-blocker,
- while worsening heart failure (7 studies, OR 0.69, 0.58-0.82, p<0.0001, I2=11%, p<0.0001) and malignant ventricular arrhythmias (4 studies, OR 0.40, 0.21-0.60, p<0.00001, I2=0%, p=0.67) were less frequently observed in the beta blocker arm.
- Rate of syncope was similar in both arms (4 studies, OR 1.00, 0.79-1.26, p=0.98, I2=0%, p=0.67).
- The outcome of dyspnea was examined by the RCTs that did not exclude patients on beta-agonists or those with chronic lung disease. Pooled analysis showed that dyspnea was less frequent among patients given beta-blockers (4 studies, OR 0.79, 0.63-0.98, p=0.03, I2=0%, p=0.99).

However, the etiology of the dyspnea was not specified. Although the SENIORS study analyzed safety outcomes, it was not included in the pooled analysis because the data for EF of <40% was unavailable.

GRADE Working Group grades of evidence (Please refer to table 1 for the guide). a. I2 for heterogeneity = 79, p-value of 0.0002; b. I2 for heterogeneity = 68%, p-value = 0.0010; c. I2 for heterogeneity = 74%, p-value = 0.0001

# Certainty of Evidence

There is a high certainty of evidence for the outcomes of cardiovascular mortality and heart failure-related hospitalization. On the safety outcomes, certainty of evidence was high in worsening heart failure, syncope, malignant ventricular arrhythmias, and dyspnea but moderate for the rest because of significant heterogeneity.

Existing clinical practice guidelines on heart failure management recommend starting beta-blockers among patients with an ejection fraction of less than or equal to 40% with high quality certainty of evidence and strong strength of recommendation. The CCS/CHFS, ACC/AHA/HFSA, JCS/JHFS, and ESC define reduced ejection fraction as an ejection fraction of less than or equal to 40% while the National Heart Foundation of Australia and the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand define reduced ejection fraction as an ejection fraction of less than 50%.

The CCS/CHFS Heart Failure guideline recommends stabilizing symptoms prior to starting beta-blocker treatment (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).

The National Heart Foundation of Australia and the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand advise the use of the following beta-blockers: bisoprolol, carvedilol, controlled-release metoprolol, and nebivolol.
---
# Beta-Blockers in Heart Failure Management

In the 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA guideline, three beta-blockers—bisoprolol, carvedilol, and sustained-release metoprolol succinate—are recommended to reduce mortality and hospitalizations among patients with HFrEF.

The recommendations from the NICE 2010 heart failure guidelines in relation to beta-blockers are the same in the 2018 guidelines: beta-blockers licensed for heart failure should be used. For patients who were previously on a different beta-blocker for another disease entity (e.g. hypertension), the previous beta-blocker should be changed to a beta-blocker for heart failure. Beta-blocker treatment should be started in a ‘start low, go slow’ manner: heart rate, blood pressure, and clinical status should be checked during each dose adjustment (in relation to the usual adverse events such as dizziness, hypotension, and arrhythmia, that caused patient withdrawal during the run-in period of major clinical trials).

A more detailed table on the recommendations of international groups can be found in Annex 11, Appendix 11.

# Ongoing Studies

An epidemiologic study may be done after implementation of these recommendations to evaluate its effect in the all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and heart failure hospitalization compared to those currently seen in the country (e.g. in the Heart Failure Registry being done, or compared to the 2014 epidemiologic burden of hospitalization study).

# Additional Considerations for Evidence-to-Decision (EtD) Phase

Comparing the prices of beta-blockers for heart failure (bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol succinate)—approximately between Php 442.00 and Php 592.00 per month, depending on brand and on frequency of intake and the price of hospitalization for heart failure—the estimated price of hospitalization was already between Php 19,340.00 and Php 28,220.00 in a government hospital and between Php 28,370.00 and Php 41,800.00 in a private hospital in 2014. However, the reviewer did not encounter economic evaluation studies for the use of beta blockers in the local setting.

A cost-effectiveness study on the use of beta-blocker in patients with chronic HF was done in Japan in 2004 by Inomata et al. The assumptions of the study are as follows: that patients were 60 years old and were of NYHA Class II to III; that the patients receive regular outpatient care and testing; and that the patients receive conventional treatment (which was, at the time, diuretics, ACEI and digitalis). Two groups were assessed: one group received conventional treatment while the other received carvedilol on top of conventional treatment. Itemized costs show a higher outpatient
---
cost for the carvedilol group, and that the carvedilol group spent a greater amount on medication costs because of a concomitantly longer life span. However, the carvedilol group also spent a smaller amount with regards to heart failure-related hospitalization. The use of carvedilol was more cost-effective compared to conventional treatment.

In another study done in the US in 2013 by Banka et al.37 regarding the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of different HF treatments which included beta-blockers, the comparisons were diuretics alone, versus other standards of care. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of ACEi+BB+AldA versus ACEi+BB was $501 and $34 per life-year for the ACEi+BB+AldA versus ACEi+BB cohort. The use of beta blockers in the treatment of heart failure was more cost-effective compared to the other cohort.

It was found that the ACEi/beta-blocker group benefited from more quality-adjusted life years, less total healthcare cost, and more cost-savings per life-year lived compared to the diuretics alone group.

# PATIENT’S VALUES AND PREFERENCE, EQUITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND FEASIBILITY

No local studies were found. However, a study done in the United Kingdom was published last 2008 showed that among patients diagnosed with heart failure, women and patients living in areas with low socioeconomic status are less likely to be prescribed beta-blocker treatment by primary care physicians even in the absence of contraindications.38 Moreover, there were patients who were prescribed other types of beta-blockers.

Given that the effect of beta-blockers in heart failure is not a class effect, and given that the intake of specific beta-blockers significantly decreased the incidence of cardiovascular mortality, heart failure mortality and heart failure-related hospitalization, it must be ensured that the specific beta-blockers that have been proven beneficial for heart failure be prescribed to all patients diagnosed with HFrEF as long as there are no contraindications with regards to blood pressure, heart rate, the presence of high grade AV block, history of severe bronchospasm, that are present.

Among adult Filipinos diagnosed with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection (HFrEF) at the outpatient clinic, what is the effect of RAAS-blockers (ACEi/ARB or ARNis) on the incidence of cardiovascular mortality, heart failure-related hospitalization, and quality of life?

# CONSIDERATIONS

The consensus panel (CP) considered the following when formulating these recommendations:

- There was a discussion regarding the network analysis which showed statistically significant benefit of ARNis on the hard outcomes compared to ARBs or ACEis. The panelists also compared the costs of ARNis against the costs of ACEis or ARBs, as well as the cost of the monthly use of ARNis against the cost of hospitalization. There was a unanimous vote on statement number 2.
- There were 3 cycles of voting regarding the strength of recommendation of the 2nd statement. The panelists who voted for a strong recommendation mentioned that patients who use ARNis have better symptom relief and hospitalization based on real life practice. On the other hand, medication cost was a major issue for those who voted for a weak recommendation for the 2nd statement as patients with low income usually end up shifting from ARNis to the much cheaper ACEis.
---
Prior to the 3rd round of voting, the technical facilitator clarified to the CP that a strong recommendation for the 2nd statement will not be consistent with the evidence. A strong recommendation from the CP would mean that patients would universally choose the intervention over the comparator, physicians will choose to prescribe ARNis, the use of ARNis would become the standard for quality care, and can thus affect policy. The 2nd statement could be recommended as weak if the evidence is not as strong or if there are other factors such as cost, equity, or availability that could hinder the implementation of the recommendation despite its benefits.

Ten votes were cast on the 3rd and final round of voting—9 in favor of a “weak” strength of recommendation, 1 in favor of a “strong” recommendation. The panelist who voted for a strong recommendation decided on the strength of the evidence from the meta-analysis regarding the benefit of ARNis—that ARNis prevent repeated hospitalization whereas the cost of hospitalization is bigger than the cost of spending for ARNis as maintenance medication.

# KEY FINDINGS

# ACE Inhibitors

ACEis were associated with a statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality, CV mortality, and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The benefits of ACE-Inhibitors were observed when compared to placebo treatment.

# Angiotensin II Type 1-Receptor Blockers (ARBs)

Clinical trials show conflicting results regarding benefit as a class effect of ARBs on all-cause mortality, CV mortality, and hospitalization for heart failure in heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction.

There are, however, identified ARBs with clear benefits on heart failure patient outcomes—candesartan, for instance, has been shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality while valsartan has been shown to have a positive effect on hospitalization for HF inpatients. There was no statistically significant difference in the critical outcomes of all-cause mortality, CV mortality, and hospitalization for heart failure between using ARBs and using ACE-Inhibitors.
---
# Sacubitril/Valsartan

The use of Sacubitril/Valsartan decreases the risk of all-cause mortality, CV mortality, and hospitalization for heart failure compared to control (Ace-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

# INTRODUCTION

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is one of the key regulatory mechanisms of the body responsible for maintaining arterial pressure homeostasis and regulating tissue perfusion. The inappropriate activation of the RAAS has been identified as a key pathophysiological mechanism involved in chronic heart failure. In HF, the heart fails to adequately fulfill its role as a pump, leading to renal hypoperfusion and sympathetic activation. Although the initial activation of the RAAS improves cardiac output, it becomes overwhelmed over time by the opposing vasodilator and natriuretic mediators, eventually propagating the heart failure syndrome. Three drugs targeting the RAAS are the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and the angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNis), the newest among the three.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are part of first-line treatment in HFrEF. Five molecules were recommended by the European Society of Cardiology in 2016 namely captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril, and trandolapril. Angiotensin II Type 1-Receptor Blockers (ARBs) work by inhibiting the angiotensin II receptors, causing systemic vasodilatation and blood pressure reduction. Earlier clinical trials have confirmed that suppression of the RAAS by ACE-Is and ARBs reduces cardiovascular (CV) events in patients with heart failure. Angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNi) is the latest drug targeting the RAAS. Sacubitril/Valsartan is the first drug of the class and is a novel therapy that has emerged from an improved understanding of the pathophysiology of heart failure and cardiac remodeling. Clinical trials show that sacubitril/valsartan has a beneficial effect on heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

Targeting the RAAS through these three drugs have been shown in clinical trials to have a consistent mortality benefit. Thus, the majority of international guidelines consider RAAS blockers as first line treatment, and have even recommended that ARNis replace ACE-is or ARBs with a class I recommendation.

# REVIEW METHODS

Electronic databases including Pubmed, Scopus, Medline, Google Scholar, and Cochrane reviews were searched. The investigation encompassed all published studies recruiting human participants, both local and international, until January 2023 to look for relevant controlled trials. Meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials that compared renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) against placebo or standard care were included in this review. Outcomes of interest included the critical outcomes of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization for heart failure, and adverse events (Annex 12, Figure 1). Excluded from the search were non-English journals, case reports, and series. To formulate the recommendations, meta-analyses and systematic reviews of studies carried out in individuals with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction were surveyed. Two investigators independently reviewed the literature, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Revman5.3 software was used for statistical analysis. GRADE Pro was used for quantitative synthesis of clinical outcomes. The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach identifying study design, study limitations (lack of allocation concealment, lack of blinding, loss to follow-up, adherence to intention-to-treat analysis, failure to report outcomes), study inconsistencies (heterogeneity), indirectness of evidence (applicability of the studies), study imprecision, and other identified limiting characteristics. Standardized summary of evidence tables were used to present the quality of the evidence and key results in a transparent and reproducible fashion.

# RESULTS

# Characteristics of included studies

A network meta-analysis (NMA) of 28 randomized controlled trials including 47,407 was used in this evidence summary. The NMA directly and indirectly compared ARNis, ARBs, ACE-is, and placebo in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The etiology of HFrEF was ischemic cardiomyopathy in most trials and most of the patients had mild to moderate symptoms. In only one trial, the LIFE trial, were patients with severe (Class IV) symptoms included, making up one-third of the patient population. Different generic ACE inhibitor and ARB interventions were used but the only ARNi used was sacubitril/valsartan. No RAAS-inhibitors were used simultaneously in all trials. Comparators were either another class of RAAS-inhibitor or placebo. Critical outcomes measured include cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, and hospitalization for heart failure. Adverse events were also measured in this NMA, namely hypotension, hyperkalemia, renal failure, and angioedema.

# Efficacy outcomes

# ACE-Inhibitors vs Placebo

Seven RCTs involving 7,518 patients looking at critical outcomes of cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, and hospitalization for heart failure were included in this study. All critical outcomes showed a statistically significant benefit when ACEis were used with placebo on all-cause mortality, (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79-0.94), cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74-0.93), and hospitalization for heart failure (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.59-0.81).

outcome for which the use of ARBs showed a statistically significant benefit over placebo (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.61-0.81). For the other critical outcomes, there was a trend toward benefit regarding the use of an ARB over placebo but it was not statistically significant for all-cause mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84-1.01) and CV mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.79-1.01).

# Angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor ARNi vs Placebo

There are no studies (RCTs or cohorts) that compared ARNis to placebo. Thus, the network meta-analysis was used to indirectly determine the benefit of the medication. Based on the analysis, the use of ARNis benefits has a benefit on the critical outcomes of all-cause mortality (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63-0.89), CV death (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57-0.89), and hospitalizations for worsening heart failure (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.48-0.75). However, issues of indirectness (one study used inpatients) and imprecision downgraded the certainty of evidence, thus the low rating.

# ARNi vs ACEi or ARB

All clinical trials compared ARNI to either an ARB or an ACEi. Based on the seven (7) RCTs available, ARNi was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.89), cardiac death (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.89), and hospitalization for heart failure (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.48-0.75) when compared to ARBs and ACE inhibitors.

# Table 52. Summary of Findings of ARNi compared to ARB/ACEi (See Annex 12)

# Safety outcomes

On the network meta-analysis, four major adverse events were analyzed, namely hypotension, hyperkalemia, renal failure, and angioedema. For renal failure, there is a statistically significant benefit with the use of ARNi compared to ARBs (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47-0.96). For the outcome of hypotension, there is a statistically significant harm with the use of ARNi when compared to ACEis (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.27- 2.34) or ARBs (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.02 – 2.10). Meanwhile, there is no statistically significant difference between the use of an ARNi and of ARBs/ACEis for the outcomes of hyperkalemia and angioedema.

There is a statistically significant harm in terms of renal failure with the use of ARBs (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.07 – 1.83) compared to ACE-is but there are no statistically significant differences for the outcomes of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and even angioedema. When compared to placebo, the use of ACE-Is is associated with a statistically significant increase in hypotension (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.23 – 2.55) and hyperkalemia (RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.09 – 3.60) but it has no such effect on renal failure and angioedema. Similarly, indirect comparison of ARNi to placebo showed harm due to an increased risk for hypotension (RR 2.98, 95% CI 1.91-4.67) and hyperkalemia (RR 2.55, 95% CI 1.32 to 4.90) but not for renal failure or angioedema.

                   Certainty of Evidence

                   The ARNI vs ARB analysis included the LIFE trial, which included patients who were
                   diagnosed with HF NYHA Class IV, so indirectness was downgraded to serious,
                   resulting in a moderate certainty of evidence. The certainty of evidence for ARNi vs
                   placebo was downgraded to low because it was an indirect analysis from the network
                   meta-analysis (observational study). The rest of the GRADE Pro analyses of certainty of
                   evidence were rated high. (Annex 12, Appendix tables 5 to 8)

                   RECOMMENDATIONS FROM OTHER GROUPS

                   All the international guidelines have already recommended that RAAS blockers be given
                   to patients with HFrEF. They have also recommended that ARNis be given if a patient
                   has not received ACEis or ARBs. The Canadian guidelines also mentioned that ARNis
                   are the preferred choice over ACEis or ARBs.

In the UK, the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained by using sacubitril/valsartan (using cardiovascular mortality) was £17,100 (€20,400) versus using enalapril. In Denmark, the ICER for sacubitril/valsartan was Kr 174,000 (€22,600). In Colombia, the ICER was COP $39.5 million (€11,200) per QALY gained. In all three countries, sacubitril/valsartan is likely to be more cost-effective compared to an ACEi (the current standard of care) in patients with HFrEF.17

In Indonesia, therapy with sacubitril/valsartan had an ICER of IDR 26,742,098 or USD 1,890 per QALY gained compared to enalapril based on a healthcare system perspective. When willingness to pay thresholds of GDP per capita was used, this result was considered cost-effective. Reductions in mortality, hospitalization, and the cost of sacubitril/valsartan also appeared to have the most influential impact on the ICER.18

Differences in “cost-effectiveness” in these two countries demonstrate that the results may vary depending on where the study is conducted. Thus, applying the results to another setting is problematic.

# ACE-Inhibitors/Angiotensin II Type 1-Receptor Blockers (ARBs)

Based on the search conducted on economic evaluation for these drugs, the reviewer did not encounter economic evaluation studies of individual medications. It is important to note that majority of the drugs have already been included in the Philippine National Formulary.

# 11. Among adult Filipinos diagnosed with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection (HFrEF) at the outpatient clinic, what is the effect of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists on the incidence of cardiovascular mortality, heart failure-related hospitalization, and quality of life?

# CONSIDERATIONS

The consensus panel considered the following when formulating these recommendations:

- Despite the overall low certainty of evidence, the CP gave a strong recommendation because there is moderate to high certainty of evidence in reducing critical outcomes of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and hospitalizations for heart failure with the use of MRAs.
- Spironolactone is included in the Philippine National Drug Formulary; however, at the time of writing, eplerenone is not.

# KEY FINDINGS

Six randomized trials were included in the evidence summary. These trials showed that there was an improvement in CV mortality and all-cause mortality, and a reduction in hospitalization from heart failure associated with MRA use. There was also a higher risk of hyperkalemia associated with the use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) compared to placebo. MRA use did not increase the risk of gynecomastia, renal impairment, worsening heart failure, hypotension, and death. There was no difference in quality of life with MRA use compared to placebo. The overall certainty of evidence is moderate.

# INTRODUCTION

Activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor by both aldosterone and cortisol plays a central role in congestive heart failure. Consequently, mineralocorticoid receptors are overexpressed in the failing heart. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) have thus been incorporated in the treatment of congestive heart failure.1

The diseases of the heart rank as the most common cause of mortality in the Philippines with 102,936 deaths noted.2 The Heart Failure Registry of patients under the Philippine Heart Association’s Council on Heart Failure showed that the majority of cases of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction was caused by ischemic heart disease, followed by hypertension, then by rheumatic heart disease. Most of the cases were also classified under NYHA FC III. Cardiac complications occurred during hospitalization in 13.2% of included patients with an overall mortality rate of 3.9%.3

# REVIEW METHODS

A systematic search was done using Medline, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar using the search terms “congestive heart failure”, “eplerenone”, and “spironolactone”. Studies comparing the use of eplerenone or spironolactone with placebo or standard-of-care which included adult patients were included. Relevant clinical practice guidelines were likewise retrieved and the references of these were also included. Studies which included patients with NYHA IV and acute, decompensated heart failure were excluded from the search.

Outcomes of interest included mortality, hospitalization from heart failure, quality of life, and adverse events. No limits were placed on age and on the dosing of the medications. The Risk of Bias Tool was used to determine the risk of bias among the studies. Relative risks for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference for continuous data were pooled whenever possible using Review Manager. Meanwhile, certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADEPRO.

# RESULTS

# Characteristics of included studies

Six randomized trials were included in the evidence review investigating the use of spironolactone and eplerenone among patients with HFrEF.1,4-10 Patients enrolled included NYHA I-III participants with cut-offs for ejection fraction ranging from less than 30% to 45%.
---
# Efficacy outcomes

Evidence was available for all the critical outcomes: all-cause mortality, CV mortality, heart failure-related hospitalization, and quality of life. For the outcomes of all-cause mortality, CV mortality, and hospitalization from heart failure, two studies were included. Two studies investigated the quality of life among patients. The adverse events of treatment were reported in six studies. Four studies were deemed at high risk for bias due to low sample sizes and high attrition rates.

# Based on two trials, the use of MRAs has a significant benefit on cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, and hospitalizations from heart failure.

|Outcome (total number of patients)|Number of patients|Relative risk (RR), 95% CI|Interpretation|Certainty of evidence|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Cardiovascular mortality|2867|0.78 [0.64, 0.96]|Benefit|Moderate|
|All-cause mortality|3164|0.81 [0.68, 0.97]|Benefit|Moderate|
|Hospitalizations from heart failure|2953|0.64 [0.54, 0.77]|Benefit|High|

# Quality of life

Based on one trial, there was no difference in quality of life scores after administration of MRAs using the visual analog scale.

|Outcome|Number of patients|Mean difference (MD), 95% CI|Interpretation|Certainty of evidence|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Quality of life|40|0.04 [-0.58, 0.66]|No significant difference|Low|
---
# Safety outcomes

Based on four randomized trials, there was a higher risk of hyperkalemia with the use of MRA compared to placebo. The use of spironolactone is associated with other adverse events such as hypotension, worsening of renal function, metabolic abnormalities (hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hypochloremic alkalosis, hyperuricemia, and hyperglycemia), precipitation of gout, gynecomastia, and impaired neurological function/ coma in patients with hepatic impairment, cirrhosis and ascites. (FDA) The use of eplerenone is associated with hyperkalemia, myocardial infarction, abnormal renal function, gynecomastia, mastodynia, and abnormal uterine bleeding. (FDA).

# Table 56. Adverse events associated with MRA use

|Outcome|Number of patients|Relative risk (RR), 95% CI|Interpretation|Certainty of evidence|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Hyperkalemia|3204|2.31 [1.71, 3.12]|Harm|Low|

Certainty of evidence: The outcomes on all-cause mortality and CV mortality were downgraded because of risk of bias. The adverse events outcomes were downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision. The overall certainty of evidence is low.

# RECOMMENDATIONS FROM OTHER GROUPS

# Table 57. Recommendations from Other Groups

|Group or Agency|Recommendation|Strength of Recommendation/ Certainty/Quality of Evidence|
|---|---|---|
|AHA 202211|In patients with HFrEF and NYHA class II to IV symptoms, an MRA (spironolactone or eplerenone) is recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality if eGFR is >30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and serum potassium is <5.0 mEq/L.|(IA)|
---
Careful monitoring of potassium, renal function, and diuretic dosing should be performed at initiation and closely monitored thereafter to minimize the risk of hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency. In patients taking an MRA whose serum potassium cannot be maintained at &lt;5.5 mEq/L, the MRA should be discontinued to avoid life-threatening hyperkalemia. (3B-NR)

# ESC 2021

An MRA is recommended for patients with HFrEF to reduce the risk of hospitalization and death. (IA)

# Australian Guidelines 2018

Recommendation: An MRA is recommended in all patients with HFrEF associated with a moderate or severe reduction in LVEF (LVEF less than or equal to 40%), unless contraindicated or not tolerated, to decrease mortality and decrease hospitalisation for heart failure. (Strong recommendation FOR; high quality of evidence.)

# Patient’s Values and Preference, Equity, Acceptability, and Feasibility

In a Swedish Registry of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction patients, only 40% of patients were given MRAs. Factors associated with non-use of MRAs included lower creatinine clearance (&lt;60 mL/min), no diuretic use, higher blood pressure, no digoxin use, higher ejection fraction, outpatient setting, older age, lower income, ischaemic heart disease, male sex, follow-up in primary vs. specialty care, lower NYHA class, and absence of hypertension.

Guideline-directed therapy such as the use of beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptors antagonists, and ivabradine was underutilized. Only 26.5% of patients received an MRA as part of treatment.

# 12. Among adult Filipinos diagnosed with chronic heart failure (HFrEF) at the outpatient clinic, what is the effect of Sodium-Glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors on the incidence of cardiovascular mortality and heart failure-related hospitalization, and quality of life?

# CONSIDERATIONS

The consensus panel considered the following when formulating these recommendations:

- There was a unanimous vote on the recommendation for SGLT2i for the treatment of HFrEF considering the benefit from the use of the medication and the local study on its cost effectiveness.

# KEY FINDINGS

There were four randomized controlled trials that assessed the efficacy and safety of sodium-glucose transport protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibition with dapagliflozin or empagliflozin compared to placebo in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The use of SGLT2 inhibitors significantly reduced cardiovascular mortality, death from any cause, hospitalization from heart failure, and worsening of kidney function compared to placebo. There was also an improvement in the quality of life (QoL) as measured by the KCCQ score. There was no significant difference between SGLT2 inhibitors and placebo on the incidence of volume depletion, fractures, amputations, major hypoglycemia among those with diabetes, diabetic ketoacidosis, and complicated urinary tract infection. However, compared to placebo, there was an increase in the incidence of genital infections with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors.

Allocation concealment was not clear in one of the four trials but the overall risk of bias remained low. Cardiovascular mortality, death from any cause, hospitalization for heart failure, improvement in the quality of life, and worsening of kidney function had high certainty of evidence. Most of the safety outcomes had moderate certainty of evidence due to the small number of events obtained and the wide confidence interval.
---
Overall, SGLT2 inhibitors showed efficacy in the cardiovascular and renal outcomes without an increased risk of serious adverse events (except for genital infections) in HF patients with reduced EF.

# INTRODUCTION

Measures to alleviate the epidemiologic1,2 and economic burdens3 in the Philippines are imperative, especially those that will reduce cardiovascular outcomes. A class of drugs that recently came out was the sodium-glucose transport protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. Before the advent of the specific Heart Failure (HF) trials, the cardiovascular outcome trials using SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) were used among diabetics with a high cardiovascular risk profile or established atherosclerotic CVD4,5,6 and even on patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD)7. Findings showed significant reduction in death from cardiovascular causes,4 hospitalization for heart failure,4,5,6 and death from any cause.4 There was also benefit seen with the use of SGLT2 inhibitor in the composite endpoint of a sustained decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate of at least 50%, end-stage renal disease, or death from renal disease.5,6,7

The mechanisms proposed could be due to its cardioprotection (eg. decrease heart rate, decrease fluid congestion), renoprotection (e.g. decrease sympathetic tone, decrease interstitial fluid), and direct SGLT2i effects (e.g. natriuresis)8.

There are now completed trials on SGLT2is that focused on patients with HFrEF, regardless of diabetes status at baseline. Hence, it is the aim of this review to determine the direction and magnitude of the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors compared to placebo among patients with HRrEF when it comes to efficacy and safety outcomes. Other considerations like cost-effectiveness will also be reported. The data provided can hopefully help determine the recommendation of its use in the local setting.

# REVIEW METHODS

The selection criteria for the included studies were randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) on patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (EF ≤ 40%) that enrolled patients on any sodium-glucose transport protein 2 (SGLT) inhibitors versus placebo and reported on at least one of the efficacy measures. For the efficacy outcomes, the trial must have investigated any of the following outcomes: cardiovascular mortality; death from any cause; hospitalization for heart failure; and change in the quality of life (QoL) based on Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) score. Selected safety endpoints were also included in the review, namely: worsening kidney function; volume depletion; fracture; amputation; major hypoglycemia among those with DM; diabetic ketoacidosis; complicated urinary tract infections (UTI); and genital infections.
---
# Exclusion criteria

Exclusion criteria included the following: Observational or nonrandomized trials; trials combining and comparing SGLT2 inhibitors with another pharmacological agent (e.g. ACE, ARB, ARNI, MRA); and trials reporting only on mechanistic or surrogate outcomes (e.g. change in the levels of NT-proBNP).

# Search strategy

The search strategy (Annex 14, Appendix A) for the identification of studies used the Medline database of the National Institute of Medicine at Pubmed, Cochrane Library, and Herdin Plus from December 2022 to January 2023.

# Key search terms

Key search terms were “Sodium-glucose transport protein 2 (SGLT) inhibitors”, “empagliflozin”, “dapagliflozin”, “canagliflozin”, “ertugliflozin”, “remogliflozin”, “luseogliflozin”, “cardiovascular mortality”, “all-cause death”, “death from any cause”, “hospitalization for heart failure”, “quality of life”, “adverse effects”, “safety profile”, “side effects”, “adults with chronic heart failure”, “adults with reduced ejection fraction”, “randomized, controlled”, and “placebo” as free text, MeSH terms, and a combination of the above. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow chart (Appendix B) summarized the search and study selection process.

# Bias assessment

To assess the potential for bias, the Cochrane risk of bias assessment criteria were used. Pooled risk ratio and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for estimates using the Mantel-Haenszel and inverse variance for efficacy and safety outcomes, respectively. Review Manager 5.4.1 was used for all statistical analyses.

# Results

# Characteristics of included studies

Four randomized placebo-controlled trials were found including 9,052 patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. All trials compared SGLTis versus placebo in addition to guideline-directed treatment for HFrEF. Two studies used dapagliflozin (10 mg once a day) while two trials used empagliflozin (10 mg once a day) as treatment. Three studies reported on cardiovascular mortality, death from any cause, and hospitalization for heart failure. Four studies reported on the quality of life (QoL) based on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) score. All four studies provided data on adverse events. All efficacy outcomes were considered critical while the safety outcomes were considered important.

The median follow-up was 18.2 months for DAPA-HF15 and 16 months for EMPEROR-Reduced17. Both DEFINE-HF16 and EMPERIAL-Reduced18 were completed in 12 weeks. The mean age ranged from 61.3 years to 69.0 years and the mean EF was 26% to 31.1%. The mean GFR ranged from 62.2 mL/min/1.73m2 to 69.0 mL/min/1.73m2 or a median of 55 mL/min/1.73m218. Other2 details on the baseline characteristics of the included trials are in Annex 14, Appendix C.

DAPA-HF15, EMPEROR-Reduced17, and EMPERIAL-Reduced18 have low risk of bias on the following parameters: selection, performance, detection, attrition, and reporting bias. Allocation concealment was not mentioned in DEFINE-HF making the selection bias partially unclear. However, the other parameters all have low risk of bias. Moreover, DEFINE-HF contributed only a weight of 0.2% in the efficacy outcomes and a weight of 1.3 to 8.2% in the safety outcomes which implies that it may not have a major impact in the direction and magnitude of the results. Hence, DEFINE-HF can still be considered as having a low risk of bias.

# Cardiovascular mortality

Three studies 15,16,17 reported on cardiovascular mortality. The pooled sample included 8,737 patients. Results showed that there was a significant 13% reduction in cardiovascular death (RR 0.87, 95% CI = 0.77-0.99, I2 = 0%) with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors on top of recommended or guideline-directed treatment for HFrEF compared to placebo. The absolute effect (95% CI) was 14 fewer per 1,000 (from 25 fewer to 1 fewer). The certainty of evidence is high.

# Death from any cause

Three studies [15,16,17] reported on death from any cause. The pooled sample included 8,737 patients. Results showed that there was a significant 12% reduction in death from any cause (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79-0.99, I2 = 0%) with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors compared to placebo on top of recommended or guideline-directed treatment for HFrEF. The absolute effect (95% CI) was 16 fewer per 1,000 (from 29 fewer to 1 fewer). The certainty of evidence is HIGH.

# Hospitalization for heart failure

Three studies 15,16,17 reported on hospitalization for heart failure. The pooled sample included 8,737 patients. The results showed that there was a significant 27% reduction in hospitalization for heart failure (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.65-0.81, I2 = 0%) with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors on top of recommended or guideline-directed treatment for HFrEF compared to placebo. The absolute effect (95% CI) was 41 fewer per 1,000 (from 54 fewer to 29 fewer). The certainty of evidence is high.

# Quality of Life (QoL)

Four studies 15-18 reported on the quality-of-life score using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire or KCCQ. The KCCQ is a 23-item, self-administered instrument that “quantifies physical function, symptoms (frequency, severity, and recent change), quality of life, and social function.” 16 The score ranged from 0 to 100 and a higher score indicated fewer symptoms. An increase of 5 points from baseline is considered a clinically important change and translates to better quality of life. 16,19 The domain of KCCQ-total symptom score (KCCQ-TSS) included a symptom frequency score and a symptom burden score. Meanwhile, the domain of KCCQ-clinical summary score (KCCQ-CSS) covered the physical limitation score and the KCCQ-TSS. Both the DAPA-HF 15 and the EMPERIAL-Reduced 18 trials measured mean change in the KCCQ-TSS while the EMPEROR-Reduced trial 17 reported on the mean change in the KCCQ-CSS. The DEFINE-HF 16 reported on the proportion of patients with ≥5 point improvement in KCCQ-CSS.

# Quality of Life Outcomes

Of the four studies that reported on QoL outcome, it was the DEFINE-HF study16 that showed a clinically meaningful improvement of ≥5 points in KCCQ-clinical summary score domain at 12 weeks with the use of dapagliflozin compared to placebo (aOR 2.35, 95% CI 1.31-4.22).

Three studies reported on the mean change of KCCQ score from baseline15,17,18. Combining the three trials (Appendix D, Figure 4A) yielded an inconclusive result (Std. MD 2.71, 95% CI --0.50-5.93, I2 = 100%) with a significant test for heterogeneity. This could be attributed to the different scoring systems used and the different timelines during which the scores were re-measured.

A sensitivity analysis (Appendix D, Figure 4B) was done and pooled only the trials15,18 that measured the same domain: KCCQ-TSS. There was, however, an increase in the mean total symptom score by almost four points (MD 3.73, 95% CI 2.08-5.39, I2 = 89%) which translated to an improvement in symptoms. The test for heterogeneity was still significant; this can be attributed to the different timelines or periods of observation for getting the KCCQ-TSS scores. DAPA-HF and EMPERIAL-Reduced were taken at the 8th month and the 12th week, respectively. The longer follow-up may have had a different impact on the magnitude of symptom improvement as compared to a shorter follow-up.

Another sensitivity analysis (Appendix D, Figure 4C) was done and pooled only the trials15,17 that measured KCCQ scores after a longer observation period, on the 8th to 13th month. The result was inclusive (MD 2.20, 95% CI -1.82-6.22, I2 = 100%) and the test for heterogeneity was significant.

In this regard, the three studies could not be combined. Instead, the results of the individual studies would be reported. Both DAPA-HF15 and EMPERIAL-Reduced18 showed an improvement in the KCCQ-TSS domain with resulting mean differences of MD 1.18 (95% CI 1.11 to 1.26) and MD 4.55 (95% CI 1.018-7.93), respectively. EMPEROR-Reduced17 used the KCCQ-CCS domain and likewise showed an improvement (MD 1.7, 95% CI 0.5 to 3.0).

All four trials have low risk of bias; the certainty of evidence remains high.

For the efficacy outcomes, the detailed forest plots are in Annex 14, Appendix D. The detailed GRADEPRO table is in Annex 14, Appendix E.

# Safety Outcomes

The safety outcomes investigated were: 1) Worsening renal function; 2) Volume depletion; 3) Fractures; 4) Amputations; 5) Major hypoglycemia among those with
---
diabetes; 6) Diabetic ketoacidosis; 7) Complicated UTI; and 8) Genital infections. All the safety outcomes were considered important.

Among the eight safety outcomes, only worsening of renal function was reduced (by 39%) with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors compared to placebo (RR 0.61, 95% CI = 0.45-0.84, I2 = 0%). The pooled sample was from four trials consisting of 9,049 patients. The absolute effect (95% CI) was 9 fewer per 1,000 (from 13 fewer to 4 fewer).

No significant difference in effect was observed between SGLT2 inhibitors and placebo for the six other safety outcomes: volume depletion (RR 1.10, 95% CI = 0.95-1.26, I2 = 0%); fractures (RR 1.03, 95% CI = 0.78-1.37, I2 = 0%); amputations (RR 0.1.18, 95% CI = 0.67-2.08, I2 = 0%); major hypoglycemia among those with diabetes (RR 1.16, 95% CI = 0.53-0.2.56, I2 = 0%), diabetic ketoacidosis (RR 7.01, 95% CI = 0.36-135.61, I2 = 20%); and complicated UTI (RR 1.20, 95% CI = 0.62-2.32, I2 = 0%). The wide confidence intervals for amputations, major hypoglycemia among those with diabetes, diabetic ketoacidosis, and complicated UTI were due to the small number of events per group. Diabetic ketoacidosis in particular was based on only one trial (DAPA-HF) because the other three trials reported zero events in both the SGLT2 inhibitor and placebo groups.

However, there was a significant increase in the incidence of genital infections (RR 2.47, 95% CI = 1.30-04.69, I2 = 0%). Based on two studies, the incidence of genital infections for SGLT2 was 1.6% and 0.6% for placebo. The absolute effect (95% CI) was 9 more per 1,000 (from 2 more to 24 more). The wide confidence interval was also due to paucity of events.

The tests for heterogeneity for all the eight safety outcomes were not significant. Below is the table containing a summary of findings on the safety outcomes described above. For the safety outcomes, the detailed forest plots are in Annex 14, Appendix D. The detailed GRADEPRO table is in Annex 14, Appendix E.

# Certainty of evidence

The certainty of evidence was HIGH for the following outcomes: 1) cardiovascular mortality; 2) death from any cause; 3) hospitalization for heart failure; 4) change in the quality of life using KCCS score; 5) worsening renal function; 6) volume depletion; and 7) fracture. The certainty of evidence was MODERATE for the following outcomes: 1) amputation; 2) major hypoglycemia among those with DM; 3) diabetic ketoacidosis; 4) complicated UTI; and 5) genital infections. The reason for downgrading the certainty of evidence to moderate was imprecision (Annex 14, Appendix E), since these outcomes were not primary outcomes and were assessed using frequency reports. Based on the results, the numbers of obtained events were small with a wide confidence interval.

# RECOMMENDATIONS FROM OTHER GROUPS

Most of the recommendations of different task forces and groups added SGLT2 inhibitors to the management of patients with chronic heart failure. Four out of seven guidelines gave a class I or strong level of recommendation and a Level A or high quality of evidence for the use of SGLT2is among patients with HFrEF. The NICE guidelines recommended its use as an option but did not mention the level of evidence or the strength of recommendation. The National Heart Foundation of Australia and the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand: Guidelines for the Prevention, Detection, and Management of Heart Failure in Australia 2018, the 2017 Comprehensive Update of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines for the management of Heart Failure, and the JCS 2017/JHFS 2017 Guideline on Diagnosis and Treatment of Acute and Chronic Heart Failure recommended the use of SGLT2is for the prevention of heart failure-related outcomes among type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients with.

Strong Recommendation FOR High-Quality Evidence

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are recommended in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus associated with cardiovascular disease and insufficient glycaemic control despite metformin to decrease the risk of cardiovascular events and of heart failure-related hospitalisation.

# 2017 Comprehensive Update

Authors suggested “that the use of empagliflozin, an SGLT-2 inhibitor, be considered for patients with type 2 diabetes and established CVD for the prevention of HF-related outcomes.”

# Guideline on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Acute and Chronic Heart Failure - Digest Version [27]

From the CPG: “Among currently available SGLT2 inhibitors, empagliflozin and canagliflozin have been demonstrated to reduce the composite endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular events including cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke, and the number of hospitalizations for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and high cardiovascular risk, and are expected to improve the cardiovascular prognosis of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and high cardiovascular risk regardless of the presence or absence of heart failure. However, as patients complicated with heart failure account for only 10 to 15% of patients enrolled in these large-scale clinical studies of SGLT2 inhibitors, further studies are necessary to clarify the beneficial effects of these drugs on heart failure. Also, as there has been no evidence indicating that these results reflect class effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, the results of large-scale clinical studies of other SGLT2 inhibitors are awaited. In addition, further studies should be conducted to clarify the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients aged 75 and above.”

# Ongoing Studies and Research Gaps

There is one ongoing study with trial number NCT04249778 that is currently recruiting patients with HFrEF (N = 392) comparing Dapagliflozin to placebo. It is a randomized controlled trial that is to be held for a period of 26 weeks. The primary outcomes are a composite of HF hospital admissions, HF emergency department visits, HF urgent clinic visits, and death after acute decompensated HF admission. The secondary outcomes include KCCQ score, CHQ-SAS score, NT-proBNP, 6MWT, and HbA1C. The primary completion is estimated to be in December 2025.

# ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR EVIDENCE TO DECISION (EtD) PHASE

# COST

A local cost-utility study that measured the economic value of one intervention over another in terms of the cost necessary to provide benefit was conducted by Mendoza, et al.28 The study utilized the public healthcare provider’s perspective and determined the cost-effectiveness of giving dapagliflozin to patients with HFrEF on top of the standard treatment.

Using the lifetime Markov model to factor in the following: the efficacy results of the study on Dapagliflozin in Patients with Heart Failure and Reduced Ejection Fraction trial; the cost of the drug; Philippine age-related mortality (55 years old among Filipinos); and utilities from other studies, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (ICER) was estimated. The threshold ICER in 2019 was PHP 180,500. This was equivalent to the gross domestic product per capita of the Philippines in 2019.

The results showed that the ICER was PHP 177,868 for the drug price of PHP 44.00 and PHP 160,983 for drug price of PHP 40.00. These costs were considered cost-effective since both were below the threshold ICER of PHP 180,500.

A sub-group analysis was done among diabetic patients with HFrEF and the ICERS were even much lower—PHP 132,585 for the drug price of PHP 44.00 and PHP 120,249 for the drug price of PHP 40.00. Based on the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve, 76% of the ICERs are below the threshold ICER of PHP 180,500. Based on the cost-utility analysis28 and the current prevailing market prices, especially for Dapagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor can be considered cost-effective when added to standard therapy for HFrEF.

In the Philippines, the prevailing market prices of Dapagliflozin and Empagliflozin are PHP 44.20 and PHP 55.31, respectively, for non-seniors. For seniors, the market prices are PHP 36.00 and PHP 44.25 for Dapagliflozin and Empagliflozin, respectively. The discounts provided to senior citizens is important. However, the discounted price cannot be used in the analysis since this is not applicable to all patients who will take the drug.

On March 7, 2023, HTAC has recommended the inclusion of dapagliflozin in the Philippine National Formulary. The accompanying evidence summary mentioned that as of February 2023, four local manufacturers have already been issued a product registration certificate by the Philippine FDA. It also mentioned that the patent of the innovator drug was “expected to expire by May 2023”. Although the exact generic cost is not yet certain, a 40% reduction in the maximum wholesale price (PHP 19.44) was included in HTAC’s costing analysis apart from the drug’s maximum wholesale price as
---
# MANDATED IN EO NO. 104 [HTAC, MARCH 2023]

In view of this development, the unit cost of PHP19.44 may be used in the sensitivity analysis.

# PATIENT’S VALUES AND PREFERENCE, EQUITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND FEASIBILITY

Advances in the management of patients with chronic heart failure, particularly those with reduced ejection fraction, have been proven to reduce clinical outcomes (e.g. cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization for heart failure). Clinical benefit has been shown with the addition of SGLT2 inhibitors to the standard of care. Moreover, the cost-effectiveness of using SGLT2 inhibitors has also been demonstrated. It is a challenge especially to health care providers and health care policy makers to make the treatment available, accessible, and sustainable.

The reviewer did not come across local studies based on the search done on the use of SGLT2is among patients with HFrEF that looked into the patient’s values and preferences, equity, acceptability, and feasibility.

# 13. Among adult Filipinos diagnosed with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection (HFrEF) at the outpatient clinic, what is the effect of a timely referral to a cardiovascular specialist on the incidence of cardiovascular mortality, heart failure-related hospitalization, and quality of life?

# CONSIDERATIONS

The consensus panel considered the following when formulating these recommendations:

- Clinical clues to advanced heart failure that will benefit from referral to higher levels of care were captured in the mnemonic "I NEED HELP," as indicated in the AHA and ESC guidelines on HF. These included:
- - I - inotropes
- N - NYHA class and natriuretic peptides
- E - end organ dysfunction
- E - LV ejection fraction ≤25%
- D - defibrillator shock
- H - one hospitalization in the prior 12 months
- E - edema and escalating diuretics
- L - low blood pressure
- P - prognostic medications

These items were raised during the CP discussion to serve as guide for deliberation but were ultimately not included in the data review.

● Although the evidence review only mentioned aortic valve stenosis as a high risk feature, the consensus panel deemed that the presence of any significant valvular lesion and/or cardiac congenital abnormality should serve as a trigger for referral to higher levels of care.

● The consensus panelists agreed to define recurrent hospitalization as 2 or more hospitalizations per year.

● Other high risk features such as arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia) and QRS duration of >0.15 ms were discussed but ultimately not included based on the evidence presented.

● The consensus panel also emphasized the need to further elaborate clinical services that are unique to higher levels of care.

# KEY FINDINGS

● There are no studies that directly answer the question of timely referral to higher levels of care at the outpatient setting. Because of this, the timeliness of a referral could be indicated by the presence of certain factors associated with increased morbidity and mortality among patients with chronic heart failure.

# Studies Pertaining to Referral to Multidisciplinary Heart Failure Disease Management Programs in the Outpatient Setting

- Four RCTs that studied referrals to Multidisciplinary HF DMTs versus usual care and their impact on mortality as well as five RCTs that looked at the impact of referrals on hospitalization were analyzed. Though there were more events in terms of mortality in the HF MDT group and more HF-related hospitalizations in the usual care group, referral to multidisciplinary HF DMTs did not show any significant reduction in the two outcomes.
- Three studies included quality-of-life questionnaires but the questionnaires used varied. One study made use of several questionnaires that measured the disease-specific QoL, as well as physical and mental components but there were no significant improvements found in generic and disease-specific QoL. However, a recent study in India demonstrated an improvement in QoL in the intervention group. In the study of Kalter-Leibovici et al., there was significant improvement in generic QoL and depression scores in the group that was being managed by Multidisciplinary DMTs compared to usual care.
- All studies had risk of bias issues as there were concerns about allocation concealment, blinding, and selective reporting of outcomes. Most of the studies were done in countries where healthcare system referrals are in place, nor were there studies involving Filipinos; furthermore, the evidence that was analyzed did not directly answer the clinical question. As such, there is an issue of directness. The risk of bias contributed to the downgrading of the evidence to low certainty of evidence for the outcome of mortality, hospitalization, and quality of life.

# Introduction

Heart Failure is an important and growing health problem with a large impact on the quality of life of patients as well as on healthcare costs. Effective treatments that have greatly improved patient survival have been developed in the past years. Despite these breakthroughs, however, heart failure still has a large impact on the quality of life of patients as well as on healthcare costs.

Patients with heart failure are treated by a range of healthcare providers including primary care physicians, family medicine specialists, internists, cardiologists, and recently, disease management teams. The follow-up of heart failure patients in the outpatient setting plays a crucial role in their long-term prognosis.

The escalation of care provides many additional diagnostic and therapeutic components that are beneficial in managing patients with complex or refractory HF, including expert.
---
# Disease Management Teams

The optimization of conventional therapies, and the resources for the definitive treatment for patients who ultimately require advanced therapies.

# Higher Levels of Care

Higher levels of care pertain to secondary and tertiary hospitals. The Department of Health under the UHC program developed resource-stratified frameworks that determine the service capability that must be available to be able to manage cardiovascular diseases. For heart failure, the cardiovascular care centers that are relevant to the clinical question refer to Intermediate Level 2 hospitals and Specialty Hospitals. Intermediate Level 2 hospitals capable of providing cardiovascular care are the enhanced Level 2 hospitals which should have at least one relevant specialty, preferably an IM Department with an ICU. Similarly, Level 3 Hospitals capable of providing cardiovascular care must have a Basic or Advanced Comprehensive Cardiovascular Center.1 A component of Level 3 hospitals, both basic and advanced, is the capacity to manage all simple and some complex cardiovascular cases and requires specialized multidisciplinary teams.

# Full Clinical Services Management

Full clinical services management is the process of care coordination for patients with a chronic condition across different healthcare settings. This has been proposed as a model of care for complex chronic conditions such as heart failure. The majority of HF patients have multiple medical, social, and behavioral challenges; their care thus requires a multidisciplinary systems approach that can help them navigate and address these issues and concerns. A multidisciplinary disease management program (DMT) is the model that has been adopted in the care of heart failure (HF) patients in order to provide coordinated care within the healthcare system.8 DMT includes close coordination with and involvement of healthcare workers specially trained in heart failure management (primarily, cardiologists, HF nurses, and general practitioners) and other experts including pharmacists, dieticians, physiotherapists, psychologists, palliative care providers, and social workers through structured follow-up. Other aspects of DMT include patient education, optimization of medical treatment, psychosocial support, and improved access to care.9

# Guidelines for Referral

Several guidelines have recommended that referral to heart failure multidisciplinary teams either in secondary or tertiary care should be done for heart failure patients with high-risk features and recurrent hospitalizations.

# Heart Failure Disease Management Teams/MDTs

Heart failure disease management teams/MDTs vary in their content but the core specialist in a heart failure multidisciplinary team (MDT) should work in collaboration with the primary care team, and should include10 a lead physician with a subspecialty interest in heart failure (usually a consultant cardiologist), a specialist heart failure nurse, or a healthcare professional with an expertise in prescribing for heart failure. The specialist heart failure MDT should directly involve, or refer people to, other services, including rehabilitation services, and tertiary and palliative care, as needed.

Several systematic reviews have demonstrated that multidisciplinary disease management reduces all-cause mortality and hospitalizations in heart failure patients discharged from the hospital. As such, heart failure DMTs are part of the recent guidelines. The evidence that was reviewed regarding DMTs was limited to patients in the outpatient setting where patients with Heart Failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) are referred to DMTs.

# REVIEW METHODS

A comprehensive literature search was done from the date of the last search December 2022 until April 2023 using Medline, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar and, HERDIN plus with a combined MeSH and free text search using the terms “chronic heart failure”, “timely referral to secondary, tertiary hospitals”, “cardiology”, and “outpatient setting”.

Unfortunately, there were no studies that would likely answer the question of the timely referral of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) seen in the outpatient setting to a higher level of care. The search was then revised to include factors that affect prognosis using the search terms “chronic heart failure”, “HFrEF”, “prognostic factors”, “indicators”, and “mortality”; as well as referrals to heart failure multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) and disease management programs using the following search terms: “HFrEF in the outpatient setting”, “disease management programs”, “multidisciplinary teams”, “mortality”, “heart failure hospitalizations”, “hospitalizations”, and “quality of life”.

Because of limited evidence with regards to poor prognostic factors that prompt referral to higher levels of care, prospective cohort and retrospective cohort studies were included in this review. Bibliographic references of selected studies were also searched. After a review of the titles and abstracts, relevant studies were obtained and the full reports evaluated. All studies meeting the explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria were retained. A de novo meta-analysis of the five studies was conducted to determine the pooled estimate of the effect of referral to HF DMTs/MDTs versus usual care for explicit outcomes. A description of the studies on quality of life was also done.

The outcomes of interest include mortality, rehospitalization, quality of life, and worsening symptoms of heart failure.

# RESULTS

Two studies looking at poor prognostic factors among patients with chronic heart failure were included. One prospective observational registry by the European Society of Cardiology analyzed 7,173 chronic heart failure patients with a median follow-up time of
---
a year. The study showed that older age, lower BMI, lower SBP, geographical region (Southern vs. North European), NYHA class (III or IV), the presence of pulmonary or peripheral congestion, third heart sound, aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease, renal dysfunction, and the absence of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) to be independent predictors of 1-year all-cause mortality. (Table 62)

Another study is a retrospective review of a health care utilization database involving 14,374 patients hospitalized for HF of which 7,401 died during the four years of follow-up. Of 14,374 patients, 3,358 patients had second, 1,123 had third, and 417 had fourth hospitalizations for HF during the study period. Mortality significantly increased after each HF hospitalization. Results showed that after adjusting for age, sex, and major comorbidities, the number of HF hospitalizations was a strong predictor of all-cause death. Median survival times after the first, second, third, and fourth hospitalization were 2.4 (95% CI 2.3-2.5), 1.4 (95% CI 1.2-1.5), 1.0 (95% CI 0.9-1.1), and 0.6 (95% CI 0.5-0.9) years.

For the definition of higher levels of care, we refer to the Department of Health 2021-0001 designation of hospitals as specialty centers. In this document, the DOH

developed resource-stratified frameworks that determine the service capability of each level of facility across the care continuum. Table 63 summarizes the levels of care for cardiovascular care.3 Higher levels of care will refer to Enhanced Intermediate cardiovascular care centers (Level 2 Hospitals) and Specialty cardiovascular care centers (Level 3 hospitals capable of Basic and Advanced comprehensive cardiovascular care delivery, and the National Cardiovascular Specialty Center, the Philippine Heart Center).

We included five RCTs with a total of 890 patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction seen at the outpatient clinic who have been referred to multidisciplinary Heart Failure DMTs and followed up for at least three months. Disease management by multidisciplinary teams includes some if not all the following aspects: coordination of

care; empowerment; patient education; monitoring of symptoms and adherence to medications; titration of medications; and use of information systems and technology such as telemonitoring of weight and vital signs. A recent study in India7 compared the outcomes of follow-up at a multidisciplinary heart failure clinic vs. usual care, while a study in Germany6 looked at the effect of structured case management by a trained doctor’s assistant with feedback and follow-up with their primary care physician. One study in Israel5 involved six monthly visits to heart failure centers with cardiologist evaluation while being regularly monitored by a nurse in between visits. Meanwhile, there are two RCTs in the UK looking at the impact of referring to a specialist or to a multidisciplinary team in both primary and secondary care.

The usual care used in the studies involves follow-up with primary care physicians or cardiologists.

Outcomes measured include all-cause mortality, all-cause hospitalization, and quality of care. In terms of quality of life, most of the studies made use of were patient-reported outcomes. Since most of the questionnaires were varied, the results cannot be pooled together to come up with definite evidence. The characteristics of included studies are summarized in Annex 15, Appendix 2.

Three studies included quality-of-life questionnaires but these were patient-reported outcomes. One study6 made use of several questionnaires that measure the disease-specific QoL, as well as the physical and mental components. However, there was no significant improvement in generic and disease-specific QoL. The study used the SF-36 scale and showed that between-group differences (95%CI) at the 12th month follow-up of the physical and mental component scale of SF-36 were minimal: -0.3 (-3.0; 2.5) and -0.1 (-3.4; 3.1).

In the study of Kalter-Leibovici et al.5, there was a significant improvement in generic QoL [SF-36 physical component 1.531 (1.165 to 2.011), mental component (1.253 to 1.971), and depression scores [PHQ-9 0.688 (0.528 to 0.897)] in the group that was being managed by Multidisciplinary DMTs vs usual care. Another study in India7 showed that quality of life as assessed using the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) was better in the intervention group than in the usual care group (MLHFQ score 21.44+/-9 vs 49 +/- 12.6 p<0.01).

# Efficacy outcomes/Certainty of Evidence

Based on the 4 RCTs included, referral to HF multidisciplinary disease teams did not show any significant difference to standard of care in reducing all-cause mortality (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.87-1.35, p=0.48, I=0%).2 There also appears to have no significant reductions in heart failure hospitalizations compared to usual care based on 5 RCTs reviewed (OR 0.85 95% CI 0.69-1.03 p=0.10 I=64%).

(Table 64)

All of the studies had an overall high risk of bias due to lack of blinding leading to selection, performance and detection bias. Moreover, for heart failure hospitalization, there appears to be moderate heterogeneity with an I2 of 64%. Over-all Certainty of Evidence was then downgraded to moderate because of these serious risks of bias across the different critical outcomes. In terms of quality of life, majority of the studies were patient-reported outcomes, and since most of the questionnaires were varied, the results cannot be pooled together to come up with definite evidence.

# Safety outcomes

There was no direct evidence of harm as this issue involves the coordination of care across healthcare settings and is not a pharmacologic intervention. The caveat is that because the multidisciplinary teams are properly trained in heart failure management and there must be close coordination across the continuum of care, lack of communication and coordination may lead to medical errors.
---
# RECOMMENDATIONS FROM OTHER GROUPS

The Australian guidelines summarized the practical indicators present in patients with heart failure that were associated with an increased risk of premature morbidity and mortality. There is an increased risk of premature morbidity and mortality if two or more of the following factors are present: age >65 years; NYHA Class III or IV symptoms; Charlson Index of comorbidity Score of ≥2; an LVEF of ≤30%; living alone or remote from specialist cardiac services; depression; language barrier; (e.g. non-English speaking); lower socioeconomic status; and significant renal dysfunction (GFR <60mL/min/1.73m).152

The Canadian guidelines recommend that all patients with recurrent HF hospitalizations, irrespective of age, multimorbidity, or frailty, should be referred to a HF disease management program.15

According to the scientific statement of the American Heart Association as guidance for timely and appropriate referral of patients with advanced heart failure, poor prognostic factors in patients with advanced heart failure include: recurrent hospitalizations, defined as two prior HF-related admissions in a 12 month period; inability to tolerate GDMT; increasing burden of arrhythmias; and worsening renal function.16

Many major and international guidelines recommend referral to heart failure disease management teams. However, the evidence for this comes from RCTs where referrals are done after hospitalization. There are few studies that look into referrals to HF DMTs in the outpatient setting.

# Society Guidelines for the Management of HF

Heart Failure(15) ● Recommends that all patients with recurrent HF hospitalizations, irrespective of age, multimorbidity, or frailty, should be referred to a HF disease management program.

● (Strong Recommendation; High-Quality Evidence).

# Malaysian Guidelines for the Management of Heart Failure 2019(18)

● Recommends that HF care should ideally take place in a multidisciplinary system, allowing for shared care between the hospital (secondary or tertiary settings) and community (primary setting).

● The multidisciplinary team consists of cardiologists and/or general physicians, HF nurses, pharmacists, dieticians, physiotherapists, primary care providers, social workers, as well as geriatricians, psychologists, occupational therapists, and, when necessary, palliative care specialists. It can be done in two settings: the patient’s home or in heart failure clinics.

● HF patients with stable symptoms may be managed at the primary care level. Referral to the cardiologist should be considered in certain situations:

- De novo HF for a comprehensive workup to confirm the diagnosis, determine the etiology, and devise a management plan.
- Episodes of acute decompensation.
- Worsening HF symptoms despite appropriate therapy.
- HF complicated by symptomatic hypotension, excessive bradycardia, or limiting uptitration of pharmacotherapy.
- Symptomatic stable CAD and/or acute coronary syndrome in consideration for revascularization (PCI or CABG).
- Resuscitated cardiac arrest.
- Documented or suspected significant arrhythmias, e.g. AF, VT.
- Significant valvular disease not previously assessed, or worsening valvular dysfunction.

# ONGOING STUDIES

There are no direct studies looking into timely referrals to higher centers of care. Most of the studies involving referrals to HF DMTs are about patients who were hospitalized. There is a paucity of studies looking into the impact of referring to HF MDT’s in the primary care setting.

# ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR EVIDENCE TO DECISION (EtD) PHASE

# COST

The reviewer did not encounter local studies but since this involves training multidisciplinary HF DMTs that primarily involve cardiologists, HF nurses, general practitioners, and other experts, including pharmacists, dieticians, physiotherapists, psychologists, palliative care providers and social workers, costs may be high during the initial phase.

In a 2008 study in Canada, the cost of care in HF clinics was $52 per 30 patient-days. The projected life-expectancy of HF clinic patients was 3.91 years, compared to 3.21 years in standard care. The 12-year cumulative cost per patient in the HF clinic group was $66,532 versus $53,638 in the standard care group. The ICER was $18,259/life-year gained.

In a study that looked at the impact of a HF management program among Medicare advantage population, the results suggest that engagement in a multidimensional HF management program has the potential to positively influence patient outcomes through
---
the earlier identification of HF exacerbations, thus prompting attention to potentially harmful condition episodes, thereby reducing cost of care.21

# PATIENT’S VALUES AND PREFERENCE, EQUITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND FEASIBILITY

Currently, there are only four heart failure clinics in the country. It is not yet clear, however, if the clinics have multidisciplinary teams in place that can take care of patients at every step of the patient’s journey. As this involves training not only physicians but also allied health care workers, the diaspora of Filipino nurses and other health care workers might be a significant limitation in terms of organizing these HF multidisciplinary care teams. Limitations in technology can also be a hindrance in using technology to compensate for a lack in manpower.

# 14. Among adult Filipinos diagnosed with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection (HFrEF) at the outpatient clinic, what is the effect of palliative care on quality of life and on the incidence of cardiovascular mortality and heart failure-related hospitalization?

# CONSIDERATIONS

The consensus panel considered the following when formulating these recommendations:

- It should be understood that a referral to the palliative care service would mean that the patient shall be managed by a multidisciplinary team, including the current attending physician of the patient.
- In 2015, the Department of Health issued an Administrative Order which considered the training of primary care physicians in palliative care to address the palpable need for palliative care services, particularly in the Visayas and Mindanao regions.
- Through patient education, the palliative care physicians are able to communicate the full spectrum and benefits derived from palliative care, particularly if such is considered early in the holistic approach of patient management of patients who are chronically severely ill.
- Palliative care is primarily aimed at the alleviation of suffering and improvement in the quality of life of these patients.
- Palliative and hospice care is one of the foundational courses in Family Medicine. Thus, the Philippine Academy of Family Physicians is advocating for all family physicians to become knowledgeable in palliative care, including the development of the appropriate skills for its implementation.
---
Palliative care is not necessarily a hospital/hospice-based care. The palliative care specialists can do telehealth and/or perform home visits for patients who prefer staying at home.

The ERE clarified that hospice care specifically deals with dying patients who have less than 6 months to live, whereas, palliative care is more of a collaborative supportive care that can be applied even during the early part of the disease process (e.g. the first decompensation). Thus, palliative care is not limited only for the dying patients or those who are already in an advanced state of disease.

The early referral to palliative care service allows for other domains of palliative care (psychological, cultural) to become part of the holistic approach to HF management, and not stopping other interventions. Thus, an early integration of palliative care at the point of diagnosis may enhance patient care, and lead to medical improvement, too.

It was highlighted in the en banc meeting that the clinical course of HF patients has varying illness trajectories. A concern that has been raised is the readiness of the present palliative care specialists to cater to these HF patients. Reassurance, however, was given by the palliative care specialist who explained that the training curriculum for palliative care includes a wide array of diseases and, hence, they would be ready to take care of HF patients. The group hopes that the inclusion of palliative care in the guidelines would encourage further capacity-building for the care of HF patients and for the DOH to provide more training for primary care physicians in basic palliative care.

# KEY FINDINGS

1. There were five RCTs included in this analysis which looked into the effect of palliative care in the outpatient setting compared to the usual care among patients with heart failure.
2. Referral to a palliative care team led to a significant reduction in rehospitalization and an improvement in quality of life, with no significant reduction in mortality within a period of three to six months. Only one RCT reported a reduction in the worsening of heart failure symptoms albeit it was not significant.
3. The certainty of evidence was low due to the serious risk of bias issues. The presence of performance and detection bias stemmed from the impossibility of blinding patients, caregivers, and some of the outcome assessors due to the nature of the intervention. There was also a serious issue of imprecision regarding the worsening heart failure outcome due to a small sample size.

# INTRODUCTION

Palliative care, as defined by the World Health Organization, is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and families through the prevention and relief of suffering.1 Its framework is composed of eight domains, namely: structure and processes; physical; psychological and psychiatric; social; spiritual; cultural; ethical and legal; and lastly, care of the patient nearing the end of life.2 A palliative care team may consist of family medicine–palliative care specialists, general cardiologists, heart failure specialists, nurses, counselors, and social workers.

Palliative care is a well-established part of management among cancer patients and other chronic illnesses, especially among those in the advanced stage of their disease. Multiple studies have shown that palliative care interventions are associated with improvements in quality of life and symptom burden.3 Therefore, we will review the evidence regarding its role among heart failure patients in the outpatient setting.

# REVIEW METHODS

A systematic search was done using Pubmed, Google scholar, Cochrane review, and HERDIN plus using the following keywords: “congestive heart failure”, “palliative care”, “mortality”, “hospitalization”, “quality of life”, “outpatient”, “randomized controlled trials”, “meta analysis” and “systematic review” with a combined MeSH and free text search for the past 10 years.

Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing palliative care against usual care among heart failure patients in the outpatient setting were included in this review. Each included RCT was assessed for risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment. The outcomes of interest included mortality, rehospitalization, quality of life, and worsening symptoms of heart failure.

# RESULTS

# Characteristics of included studies

We included five RCTs (Table 65) with a total of 371 patients. These studies included patients in an advanced stage of heart failure, with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV, who were mostly recruited prior to hospital discharge and for transitional care to their homes. The teams were composed of primary palliative care specialists, general cardiologists, psychiatrists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, and nurses; some teams also had volunteer social workers. Two RCTs were conducted in the USA4,5; one RCT was from Sweden; one RCT from China7; and one RCT was from6
---
# Hong Kong

Most studies had six out of the eight domains for the ideal framework for palliative care. The mean follow-up period was six months.

The palliative care (PC) intervention arm of these trials can be described into 5Ss—structured, systematic, scheduled, synergistic, and sustained. PC is structured patient centered care which entails a multidisciplinary approach involving a team composed of clinicians (palliative care specialists, cardiologists, HF specialists, psychiatrists) and other health providers (nurses, social workers, physiotherapists, occupational therapists) whose support can vary over time.

It is systematic and reproducible; the intervention starts prior to discharge or immediately after discharge during which the goals of care and a review of a patient’s prognosis are discussed with the patient, family and caregiver. Weekly or even more frequent home visits/ telephone calls are scheduled for the monitoring of symptoms and end-organ function. There is a synergistic approach among the various specialties as to which of them may take a more central role in the coordination of patient care at different times of the disease span. The included providers are likely partial, and other team members may exist in individual teams to support patients as best as able. This is sustained care that spans throughout the disease process and extends to the bereavement phase for their family and caregivers.

The usual care intervention arm of these trials was provided mainly by clinicians (cardiologist, general practitioners) and/or nurse-led heart failure clinics. Discharge instructions were given by clinicians and, in one study, even printed materials containing information on advance care planning, prior to discharge. Unstructured home visits and phone calls of varying intervals were done depending on the clinical status of the patient. Sometimes, social calls were made consisting of light conversation topics unrelated to clinical issues.

# Efficacy outcomes/ Certainty of Evidence

Palliative care intervention was associated with a significant reduction in the number of rehospitalizations [OR 0.48, 95% CI,(0.3-0.77), p = 0.002, I2 = 2%] (Annex 16, Figure 2) and an improvement in the quality of life measure using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy questionnaire or the McGill quality of life questionnaire [Standard mean difference 0.37, 95% CI, (0.16-0.57), p = 0.0004, I2 = 0%] (Annex 16, Figure 3). The certainty of the level of evidence for both outcomes was moderate because it was downgraded by one level for risk of bias (i.e. performance and detection bias).

There was no benefit for mortality among the 4 RCTs with a total of 356 patients with substantial heterogeneity [OR 0.93, 95% CI,(0.4-2.16), p = 0.87, I2 = 58%] (Annex 16, Figure 4). However, the study by Wong et al. was excluded due to its outlying result. There were no issues of heterogeneity seen [OR 1.32, 95% CI, (0.77-2.27), p = 0.32, I2
---
The significant reduction in mortality seen in the study by Wong et al could be due to its shorter follow-up time of 84 days compared to the other studies with a longer follow-up period of six months. There was moderate certainty regarding the level of evidence due to issues with the risk of bias.

Only one RCT looked into worsening of heart failure symptoms; the study showed no significant difference between the two intervention arms [OR 0.42, 95% CI,(0.07-2.33), p = 0.32]. It also showed low certainty regarding the level of evidence due to issues with the risk of bias and inconsistency (low population size).

# Safety outcomes

There are no direct safety issues since this is a non-pharmacologic intervention. Training of staff members is of utmost importance. Poorly competent staff may lead to medication errors and miscommunication between them, the patients and the patients’ caregivers, leading to worsened symptoms, disrupted dying, serious injury, and hastened death.9

# RECOMMENDATIONS FROM OTHER GROUPS

Many international guidelines (Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and the USA) gave a strong recommendation to provide palliative care for the advanced stage of heart failure despite low quality of evidence. The guidelines mention that the involvement of a palliative care team should be part of the early trajectory of the disease based on a thorough assessment of needs and symptoms, rather than on individual estimates of patient’s remaining life expectancy.

All available guidelines unanimously recommend referral to a palliative care team for patients in the advanced stage of heart failure who are refractory to guideline medical therapy in order to alleviate symptoms, decrease rehospitalization and assist in advance care planning for end of life and extend bereavement care to the caregiver/family.

Among these guidelines, Japan has the most detailed description of what constitutes a palliative care team and of the importance of training the staff. The Japanese guidelines have also extended medical coverage to include not only hospital-based palliative care but also outpatient palliative care, such as outpatient service and in-home medical care.

Recommends that the provision of palliative care to patients with HF should be on the basis of a thorough assessment of needs and symptoms, rather than on individual estimates of remaining life expectancy.

# NICE UK Guidelines in chronic heart failure in adults: diagnosis and management 2018

[12]

These are the following statements for palliative care in heart failure:

- Do not use prognostic risk tools to determine whether to refer a person with heart failure to palliative care services.
- If the symptoms of a person with heart failure are worsening despite optimal specialist treatment, discuss their palliative care needs with the specialist heart failure multidisciplinary team and consider a needs assessment for palliative care.
- People with heart failure and their families or carers should have access to professionals with palliative care skills within the heart failure team.
- The specialist heart failure MDT should directly involve, or refer people to, other services, including rehabilitation, services for older people, and palliative care services, as needed.

# ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure 2021

[13]

Palliative care was not explicitly stated in their recommendation but it was one of the common issues identified in which there are still gaps in the evidence to determine specific options for palliative care.

They stated in one of their recommendations that it is recommended for heart failure patients to be enrolled in a multidisciplinary heart failure program.

Referral to MD-HF program was given class I recommendation with level A evidence.

# AHA/ACC/HFSA

For all patients with HF, palliative and supportive care, including high-quality communication, conveyance of prognosis, clarification of care goals, shared decision-making, symptom management, and caregiver support should be provided to improve QOL and relieve suffering.

Class I recommendation, Level of Evidence C – Limited data.

# For patients with HF, particularly stage D

HF patients being evaluated for advanced therapies, patients requiring inotropic support or temporary mechanical support, patients experiencing uncontrolled symptoms, major medical decisions, or multimorbidity, frailty, and cognitive impairment, specialist palliative care consultation can be useful to improve QOL and relieve suffering.

# Malaysia Clinical Practice Guidelines

Patients with refractory symptoms despite guideline-directed medical therapy should be considered for palliative and end of life care.

No grading for strength of recommendation and quality of evidence.

# Japanese Circulation Society/Japanese Heart Failure Society Guideline

As part of the cardiac rehabilitation of advanced heart failure, they recommend the introduction of palliative care early in stage C to improve overall quality of life and support for decision-making in selecting the treatment method.

No grading for strength of recommendation and quality of evidence.

# Focused Update on Diagnosis and Treatment of Acute and Chronic Heart Failure 2021

# Palliative Care in Heart Failure (EPC-HF)

which will enroll patients at NYHA class II or higher. This will answer the limited evidence that exists from RCTs supporting the use of interdisciplinary palliative care in the progressive course of heart failure.17

# Additional Considerations for Evidence to Decision (EtD) Phase

# Cost

The reviewer did not encounter any local economic evaluation studies. In a study conducted in Hong Kong by Wong et al, the total cost of pre-program training for the palliative care team staff is HK$ 17,349. This study also showed that over an 84-day period, the total cost of health care utilization per case was significantly less, at HK$ 10,123 for the intervention group, compared to that of the control group, at HK$ 36,206.18

The Palliative Care in Heart Failure (PAL-HF) study in the USA showed that the intervention resulted in an incremental gain of 0.033 QALYs and an incremental payment of $964 per patient, for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $29,041 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) after 36 months. This ICER was well within the ICER threshold of $50,000 adopted by the ACC-AHA which makes it a clinically attractive intervention.19

The Palliative advanced home-caRE and heart FailurE caRe (PREFER) study conducted in Sweden revealed a reduced cost of €59,412 for the intervention group as compared to the control group. This was due to reduced hospital and emergency care.20

# Patient’s Values and Preference, Equity, Acceptability, and Feasibility

The clinical course of heart failure is unpredictable. It is described as having short-term improvement after an acute decompensation event, followed by the gradual decline of function over time with no complete recovery.21 Therefore, achieving care alignment through shared decision-making with palliative care for personalized treatment should be enacted earlier in the disease process than at the very end of life. In a study done in Ontario, Canada on advanced heart failure, patients who received home-based palliative care led to changes in their treatment preferences to avoid hospitalization and focus on comfort at home with an eventual increase in out-of-hospital death.22

Ethical issues often arise in those patients with advanced heart failure in treatment decision-making (e.g. device implantation, heart transplant, advanced care, near end of life care) and integrating palliative care will aid in these dilemmas. Discussing goals and
---
Plans in preparing for death is mostly considered inappropriate and culturally insensitive, like here in the Philippines.23 The beliefs of the patients and their family have to be contemplated before approaching individuals with poor prognosis. The patient and the family should be included in the decision-making process for better communication. Therefore, these are challenges ahead that need to be overcome in order for palliative care to become an acceptable and integral part of the management of heart failure.

Last 2015, the Department of Health (DOH) enacted the National Policy on Palliative and Hospice Care in the Philippines, integrating it into our health care delivery system to provide holistic health care ranging from promotive and preventive to curative and rehabilitative. Its general objective is to set overall policy directions and identify the roles and functions of DOH and its partner agencies in the provision of palliative care in hospitals, health facilities, communities, and homes.24

Currently, there are 64 certified palliative care physicians according to the Philippine Society of Hospice and Palliative Medicine. They are mostly situated in Luzon. These physicians are trained to handle patients with chronic debilitating illnesses, mostly cancer and stroke. They also handle some heart failure patients but these patients usually only have heart failure as a comorbidity. Tertiary government hospitals such as the National Kidney and Transplant Institute and the Philippine Heart Center have recently come up with focused palliative care programs for end-stage kidney disease and for cardiovascular patients, respectively. A more comprehensive listing of palliative care specialists in the country is available via the official website of the Philippine Society of Hospice and Palliative Medicine (https://www.pshpm.org/fellows).

Like in most countries, the starting point of referral is usually at the hospital as part of transition care prior to discharge, in order to help transition the patient to home-based palliative care. The structure for an outpatient or home-based palliative care service is still lacking. There is still a need to identify and train nurses, barangay health workers, social workers (volunteers), and even physicians to recognize heart failure patients in need of palliative care and make outpatient palliative care a viable reality.

# Applicability Issues

The Heart Failure Task Force accentuates some caveats of this CPG using equity and applicability lenses. Comprehensive history taking, physical examination, and monitoring are essential in the evaluation of patients suspected or confirmed to have heart failure. These mandatory clinical processes must be emphasized to all primary care providers, regardless of their geographic or logistical setting. The unavailability or inaccessibility of recommended diagnostic tests, medications, and services in selected areas in the country is, however, a real-world concern that must be carefully reviewed and addressed by concerned policy-makers and stakeholders at the local (e.g. municipal health offices, rural health units, private medical facilities) and national levels (e.g. Department of Health, PhilHealth). The CPG task force is cognizant of the fact that not all ideal diagnostic tools are at the disposal of the patient and primary care provider, owing to cost and access issues. Moreover, some evidence-based and guideline-recommended therapeutics are included in the Philippine National Formulary (PNF), such as ACEis and ARBs, ARNi (Sacubitril/Valsartan), beta-blockers (Bisoprolol and Carvedilol), diuretics (Furosemide) and MRA (spironolactone). On March 2023, a SGLT2 inhibitor (dapagliflozin) was approved for inclusion in the PNF (DOH department circular 2023-0169), albeit as an add-on drug to Metformin for adult patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus who have or are at high risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetic nephropathy. Other heart failure drugs like Empagliflozin (SGLT2 inhibitor), Metoprolol Succinate and Nebivolol (beta-blockers), and Eplerenone (MRA) have not yet been approved for inclusion.

The task force looks forward to proactive efforts from concerned sectors in order to update guidance documents (e.g. PNF) and policies (e.g. PhilHealth) as well as pursue more capacity-building initiatives (e.g. Department of Health and professional medical societies).

Finally, this CPG does not necessarily supersede the various stakeholders’ (i.e., health professionals, hospital administrators, employers, payors, patients) values, settings, and circumstances. Although this CPG is intended to guide administrators in setting the general direction of health policies for the general population, it should not be the sole basis for reinforcing, recreating or abolishing certain health practices and procedures linked to the care of patients with heart failure.

# Barriers and Facilitators to Guideline Implementation

A holistic approach to the care of patients with heart failure entails that the patient be granted ample opportunity to benefit from the necessary diagnostic procedures and appropriate treatment. As a low-middle-income country, our limited resources need to be allocated and used efficiently. The cost of the tests and interventions being done for Heart Failure management was one important consideration discussed in the panel meetings/health technology assessment; it should be a key gatekeeping mechanism to ensure that all payments made by the government (through PhilHealth) are cost-effective. The task force is cognizant of the reality that certain diagnostic tests and therapeutic interventions may not be readily available in rural areas and limited-resource settings. In fact, some of the medications recommended in this guideline unfortunately are not yet part of the Philippine National Formulary, effectively restricting access in government hospitals. As such, the evidence-based recommendations in this guideline are hoped to shape policy and practice in the Philippines, to ensure equitable and timely access to diagnostic and therapeutic resources for all Filipino patients with heart failure.

Meanwhile, the task force also recognizes some factors that can help facilitate the application and implementation of the guidelines, such as heightened awareness campaigns, greater access to low-cost yet evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic options, and incentivization of adherence to guidelines.

The effective use and implementation of the HF guidelines will rest heavily on the mandate coming from the Department of Health. The task force hopes that such guideline recommendations will be properly cascaded to intended users through close collaboration between the national government, the implementing agency, the Philippine Heart Center, key professional societies, and local health administrators. Strategies may be developed to determine real-world use of such guidelines, looking into adherence to key recommendations and impact of their application, whether through scorecard metrics or coordinated research using rapid assessment methods and quality of care analysis. Such evaluations may be planned based on pre-specified intervals, depending on the current need of the health industry.

# Monitoring and Evaluation

# Dissemination

The SC will submit the full-text manuscript of this CPG to the Department of Health. The Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of DOH will transmit copies of this CPG to PhilHealth, health maintenance organizations, and pharmaceutical industry partners. DOH will release a memorandum to notify all stakeholders of the publication.

This CPG will be presented during conferences and annual conventions of medical societies. Copies of this CPG with the endorsement of relevant medical institutions will be sent to medical schools and libraries to integrate the recommendations in their training curricula, with the support of faculty members and the heads of hospital-based departments, including but not limited to surgery, radiology, pathology, and internal medicine.

An executive paper as well as the full paper will be submitted for publication in reputable, peer-reviewed cardiology and medical journals. Once the article is published, the CPG will be made available on the websites of DOH, the Philippine Heart Center, different medical societies and organizations such as PMA, PAFP, PCP, PHA and NHFN. Other forms of dissemination will include press conferences, social media sites, and professional society conventions.

All strong recommendations in this guideline can be used for monitoring and auditing practices in institutions. These can be converted to key performance indicators and can also be used to create clinical pathways.

The DOH planned to develop a simplified version of this CPG and make it available in the format that will be most ready for reproduction and dissemination to patients in different health care settings. It will also be available for all interested parties by visiting the DOH website. (For more details, see pp 31-32)

# Updating of the guidelines

Considering the level of certainty in the body of evidence found for each guideline question, it is anticipated that these guidelines will need regular updating. Guidelines will be updated after three years or earlier should new important evidence become available. (For more details, see page 36-37)
---
# Research Implications/Gaps

An exhaustive search of existing literature and investigative work on all clinical questions uncovered some key gaps worth looking into:

- Signs and symptoms: paucity of robust local studies on the diagnostic accuracy of symptoms and signs of heart failure in patients seen at a primary care or general practice outpatient clinic;
- Chest X-ray: paucity of studies on accuracy, cost-effectiveness, feasibility and prognostic value of the chest X-ray as a diagnostic tool for heart failure;
- 12L ECG: absence of local studies on the diagnostic utility of the electrocardiogram for heart failure in the outpatient setting; lack of local data on availability of the 12L ECG in primary care centers; absence of local studies looking into physician proficiency in interpreting a 12L ECG;
- Echocardiogram: lack of local studies looking into the real-world utility of cardiac point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) particularly for heart failure screening and diagnosis in the outpatient or community setting;
- Baseline serum electrolytes and serum creatinine: need for studies on the impact of determining the baseline serum electrolytes and serum creatinine on mortality among patients with chronic heart failure;
- Dietary sodium and fluid restriction: lack of studies on dietary sodium and fluid restriction among patients outside the hospital setting and those who are not in acute decompensation, as well as studies specifically looking into the optimal amount of sodium and fluid intake beneficial for patients with chronic heart failure at the outpatient setting;
- Diuretics: paucity of studies providing guidance regarding optimal dose of loop diuretics as well as diuretic dosing strategies amidst newer GDMTs for outpatients with chronic heart failure;
- ARNI: lack of local studies looking into cost-effectiveness of ARNIs in the treatment of patients with heart failure at the primary care setting, and their impact on reduction of unnecessary testing and interventions;
- MRA: lack of studies investigating the use of MRAs on patients with chronic heart failure;
- SGLT2i: lack of real-world data on patients’ preference and acceptability regarding the use of SGLT2 inhibitors as one of the recommended treatment modalities for HF with reduced ejection fraction;
- Referral to higher levels of care: paucity of studies directly looking into timely referral of patients with heart failure seen at the primary care setting to multidisciplinary teams and higher centers of care.
---
# Other general recommendations include the following:

- Creation of a heart failure pathway that incorporates recommendations that have proven clinical benefit;
- Development of monitoring and evaluation tools that will examine the effects of these guideline recommendations on the quality of patient care across various institutions;
- Conduct of an updated epidemiological study on patients with heart failure in both in-patient and out-patient settings across the spectrum of ejection fractions (HFrEF, HFmrEf and HFpEF);
- The need for economic evaluation studies that include not only cost-effectiveness analyses, but also cost-utility and cost-benefit analyses. These studies can be used as tools in prioritizing cost-effective and cost-saving tests and interventions.
- Conduct of additional studies on budget impact analysis (BIA) that can be used by health policy makers to improve the Philhealth coverage of patients hospitalized for heart failure;
- Conduct of studies looking into performance metrics on the management of patients with HFrEF (e.g. adherence to GDMT; timeliness of interventions, appropriateness of referral)
- For future guideline updates, conduct of patient focus group discussions prior to development of the CPG, inclusion of representatives of Hospital administrators, Philhealth and DOH to ensure more representation of all stakeholders

Finally, with the advancements in the field of heart failure, exploring the role of precision medicine can spur the development of practice-changing research. These studies can provide answers to current questions which can influence the recommendations for updating this guideline.

# Recommendations for Future Guideline Development

Despite the methodological rigor with which this CPG was created, the task force still recognizes some areas for improvement and consideration for the formulation of the succeeding set of guidelines. These include the following:

- Use of tailored surveys and focused group discussions involving a wider range of end-users (e.g. patient groups) to more effectively capture their values and preferences;

227
---
● Creation of a document intended for patient education that shall accompany the clinical practice guideline;

● Dialogue with representatives from various stakeholders and policy makers, such as the Philippine Health Corporation (PhilHealth), hospital administrators and health economists, to obtain their insights on local laws, the guideline impact on future health directions, and their perspectives on the socioeconomic value of testing and therapy;

● Conduct of local cost-effectiveness or cost evaluation and budget impact analyses as well as health economic outcomes research.

Ultimately, the CPG task force hopes that the approval and effective dissemination and implementation of these guidelines will translate to the adoption of more enabling health policies, higher quality standards in physician practice, and better clinical outcomes for the Filipino patient with chronic heart failure.

# Explanations

a. Incorporation bias - signs and symptoms of HF (index test) were included in the diagnosis of HF (reference standard)

b. Indirectness - easy fatigability was referred to as dyspnea on climbing 1 flight of stairs. There is no generally accepted definition of easy fatigability but this is usually a perception of tiredness rather than dyspnea.

# Orthopnea

# Evidence to Decision Survey Prior to Voting

Evidence to decision survey prior to voting showed that 100% of the CP considered this clinical question as a priority problem—accurate for easy fatigability (53%), orthopnea (61.5%), PND (61.5%), elevated JVP (46.2%), rales (69.2%), and peripheral edema (46.2%); 61.5% voted for unknown for desirable and undesirable anticipated effects.

For the certainty of test accuracy:

|Condition|Certainty Level|
|---|---|
|Easy Fatigability|Low (84.6%)|
|Orthopnea|Moderate (92.3%)|
|PND|Moderate (92.3%)|
|Elevated JVP|Moderate (69.2%)|
|Rales|Moderate (84.6%)|
|Peripheral Edema|Moderate (76.9%)|

46.2% voted for moderate and 46.2% voted for no included studies on overall certainty of evidence for any critical or important direct benefits, adverse effects of burden of the test. 46.2% voted that there are no included studies on the certainty of evidence of effects of the management that is guided by the test results. 46.2% voted that there are no included studies on the certainty of the link between test results and management decisions and overall certainty of the evidence of effects of the test. 53.8% voted that it is possibly important uncertainty or variability in how much people value the main outcomes.

For balance between desirable and undesirable effects, 46.2% probably favors the intervention. As to resources required, 46.2% voted for large costs while 30.8% voted for moderate savings and 23.1% voted for negligible costs and savings. Majority (46.2%) voted for no included studies on the certainty of costs. 61.5% voted for no included studies on the cost-effectiveness.

On the impact of testing on health equity, 30.8% voted for probably increased impact and 30.8% voted for increased. The panelists voted for acceptability to key stakeholders at 61.5% and that it is feasible to implement at 92.3%. Majority of the CP (92.3%) voted for screening with strong strength of recommendation (61.5%).

The evidence to decision survey prior to voting showed that the majority of the CP considered it a priority problem and CXR is accurate for cardiomegaly and pulmonary congestion. There were moderately desirable effects; undesirable effects were unknown. There was a high certainty of evidence test accuracy for cardiomegaly and a low certainty of test accuracy for pulmonary congestion. There were no studies on the overall certainty of effects, certainty of evidence test, management and test result/management effects. Probably favors intervention and comparison for balance of effects. There is possibly no important uncertainty/variability in values. There are moderate costs and negligible cost and savings. There are no studies on the certainty of evidence of required resources. Favors intervention for cost effectiveness. The use of chest radiographs are acceptable and feasible, with probably increased equity. The majority of the CP (91.7%) voted to recommend chest X-ray for diagnostic testing with a strong recommendation (91.7%).

The Evidence to Decision survey prior to voting showed that the majority of the CP considered it as a priority problem. The 12L ECG is accurate, with moderate desirable effects and small undesirable effects. The 12L ECG has high certainty of evidence test accuracy for cardiomegaly and very low certainty of test accuracy. There were no studies on overall certainty of effects, certainty of evidence test, and test result/management effects. There is low certainty of evidence of management. There is a split vote between “probably favors intervention” and “favors intervention” comparison for balance of effects. There is also a split vote on “possibly important uncertainty/variability” and “probably no important uncertainty/variability in values.” There is negligible cost and savings. There were no studies on the certainty of evidence of required resources and cost-effectiveness. There was also a divided vote between “probably no impact” and “probably increased equity.” Majority of the CP voted that it is acceptable and feasible. Sixty percent (60%) voted for diagnostic testing with weak strength of recommendation (60%).

The evidence to decision survey prior to voting showed that the majority of the CP considered the question as a priority problem. 2D Echocardiogram with doppler is accurate, with moderate to large desirable effects and unknown undesirable effects. 2D Echocardiogram has moderate certainty of evidence test accuracy for cardiomegaly and very low certainty of test accuracy. There are no studies on overall certainty of effects, certainty of evidence test, management and test result/management effects. The votes were split between “probably favors intervention” and “probably favors comparison for balance of effects.” The CP noted its possibly important uncertainty/variability. It has a moderate cost. There are no studies on certainty of evidence of required resources and cost-effectiveness. With probably increased equity, acceptable and probably feasible. All members of the CP (100%) were for diagnostic testing with strong strength of recommendation (91.7%).

# Table 6: GRADE pro evidence profile of BNP with a threshold of more than 100 pg/ml (MCCullough et al)

The evidence to decision survey prior to voting showed that the majority of the CP considered this question as a priority problem. The use of BNP or NT-proBNP to diagnose or rule out chronic heart failure is accurate, with moderate desirable and small undesirable effects, but with low certainty of evidence of test accuracy. There were no studies on overall certainty of effects, certainty of evidence test, management effects, and test result/management effects. Probably favors comparison for balance of effects. The CP noted it as possibly important uncertainty/variability. There was a split vote between large cost and unknown. There was high certainty of evidence of required resources but no study on cost-effectiveness. Equity was unknown, probably acceptable, and there was a split vote between probably feasible and not feasible. Seventy five percent (75%) of the CP voted for diagnostic testing with weak strength of recommendation (75%).

# Risk of mortality among patients diagnosed with chronic heart failure at the outpatient clinic with baseline creatinine of >1.1 mg/dl

The evidence to decision survey prior to voting showed that the majority of the CP considered it as a priority problem. Determining serum electrolyte and creatinine levels has moderate desirable and unknown undesirable effects. It has moderate certainty of evidence of test accuracy. The vote was split between “probably favors intervention” and “favors intervention.” There were no studies on the certainty of evidence of required costs. Costs were moderate, with no study on cost effectiveness. Probably no important/uncertainty/variability, increased equity, probably acceptable and feasible. All members of the CP (100%) voted to recommend diagnostic testing with strong strength of recommendation (60%)

# Annex 9: Nonpharmacologic interventions in confirmed heart failure

# EVIDENCE TO DECISION FRAMEWORK WORKSHEET (THERAPY)

# Guideline Question

Among adult Filipinos diagnosed with chronic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction at the outpatient clinic, what is the effect of nonpharmacologic interventions (dietary sodium and fluid restriction, exercise prescription) on the incidence of mortality and heart failure hospitalization, and on quality of life?

# (1) Problem: Is the problem a priority?

|JUDGEMENT|RESEARCH EVIDENCE|ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS|
|---|---|---|
|○ No|Heart failure is a major cause of mortality and morbidity globally.| |
|○ Probably no|Although pharmacologic treatment of heart failure has been dynamic| |
|○ Probably yes|and effective in improving quality of life, non pharmacologic aspect of| |
|○ Yes|treatment remains important. Dietary salt restriction and water| |
|○ Don't know|restriction have been historically part of heart failure treatment. This| |
| |strategy became controversial with studies coming out where the| |
| |intervention was shown to not have the expected effect on clinical| |
| |outcomes. There is also evidence that sodium restriction may lead to| |
| |detrimental renal and neurohormonal effects that worsen clinical| |
| |outcomes.| |
| |Physical deconditioning in patients with heart failure is believed to be the| |
| |main cause of fatigue that stems from decreased nutritive blood flow to| |
| |the muscle and alterations in metabolism. Exercise rehabilitation has| |
| |been promoted to counteract this but studies have not shown consistent| |
| |benefit and some safety concerns for patients with reduced ejection| |
| |fraction have come up.| |

---
Large desirable effects of exercise, and salt and water restriction. Majority voted for small undesirable effects of salt and water restriction and exercise, with low certainty of evidence, probably favors intervention. No included studies on certainty of evidence for required costs, with moderate cost and no study on cost effectiveness. There was a split vote on possibly important uncertainty/variability and probably no important uncertainty/variability. Unknown equity, probably acceptable and split vote between probably feasible and feasible.

# Recommendation A

66.7% voted for treatment with a split vote of 50%-50% for weak vs strong recommendation.

# Recommendation B

91.7% voted for treatment and 58.3% for a strong recommendation.

# Explanations

- a. Unclear allocation concealment for all studies; unclear blinding of outcome assessment in some studies
- b. No data on ejection fraction. May have included patients that do not have reduced ejection fraction
- c. authors did not do statistical analysis for publication bias
- d. Some confounders may have not been accounted for: dose of diuretics, severity of heart failure

The Evidence to Decision survey conducted prior to voting showed that the majority of the CP considered the question as a priority problem. With large desirable effects of diuretics. The majority voted for moderate undesirable effects with low certainty of evidence, favoring intervention. There were no included studies regarding the certainty of evidence for required costs, with moderate cost and no study on evidence of required costs. There was negligible cost and savings with no study of cost effectiveness. There was a divided vote on equity of probably no important/uncertainty/variability with probably increased equity among the CP. Diuretic treatment was considered acceptable and feasible by the CP. One hundred percent (100%) voted for treatment with 91.7% voting for strong strength recommendation.

# Safety profile / Other notes

Within the metoprolol group, exercise capacity was significantly greater than at baseline at 6 months’ follow-up (mean increase 80 [SD 216] s, p = 0-0006) and at 12 months (76 [214] s, p = 0-0007). In the placebo group, there was a significant improvement at 6 months (47 [189] s, p = 0-0007) but not at 12 months (15 [178] s, p = 0-46). Thus, the difference between the groups in exercise capacity improvement was significant at 12 months (0-046) but not at 6 months.

- Hypotension alone: 3
- Hypotension + extreme fatigue + increased congestive symptoms or both: 9

# Beta blockers should be considered in patients with LV systolic dysfunction to decrease the risk of developing heart failure

A beta blocker is recommended in all patients with HFrEF associated with a moderate or severe reduction in LVEF (LVEF less than or equal to 40%) unless contraindicated or not tolerated, and once stabilised with no or minimal clinical congestion on physical examination, to decrease mortality and decrease hospitalisation.

Specifically, bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol (controlled release or extended release), or nebivolol.

# Operational definition of HFrEF:

Ejection fraction < 40%

# In patients with HFrEF, with current or previous symptoms, use of 1 of the 3 beta blockers proven to reduce mortality (e.g., bisoprolol, carvedilol, sustained-release metoprolol succinate) is recommended to reduce mortality and hospitalizations.

# Update information

Minor changes since publication

November 2021: We added a link to the NICE guideline on heart valve disease in recommendations 1.2.8, 1.2.15 and 1.4.2.

# For this specific guideline, it was beta-blockers in people with heart failure in atrial fibrillation

Do not withhold treatment with a beta-blocker solely because of age or the presence of peripheral vascular disease, erectile dysfunction, diabetes, interstitial pulmonary disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. [2010]

Introduce beta-blockers in a 'start low, go slow' manner. Assess heart rate and clinical status after each titration. Measure blood pressure before and after each dose increment of a beta-blocker. [2010, amended 2018]

# Grades of Recommendations

Grade A Strongly recommended and supported by strong evidence; Grade B Recommended with moderately strong supporting evidence; Grade C1 Recommended despite no strong supporting evidence; Grade C2 Not recommended because of the absence of strong supporting evidence; Grade D Not recommended as evidence indicates that the treatment is ineffective or even harmful

# Levels of Evidence

I Systematic review/meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials; II One or more randomized controlled trials; III Nonrandomized controlled trials; IVa Analytical epidemiologic studies (cohort studies); IVb Analytical epidemiologic studies (case-control studies and cross-sectional studies); V Descriptive studies (case reports and case series); VI Not based on patient data, or based on opinions from a specialist committee or individual specialists

# Evidence to Decision Survey

The Evidence to Decision survey prior to voting showed that the majority of the CP considered the question a priority problem. There were moderate desirable and undesirable effects of beta blockers, with moderate certainty of evidence, favoring intervention. There were no included studies on certainty of evidence for required costs, with moderate costs and favors intervention for cost effectiveness. Majority of the CP voted for possibly important uncertainty/variability. There was a split vote between probably increased and increased for equity. Majority of the CP voted that it is feasible and acceptable. All members of the CP (100%) voted for treatment with 100% vote of strong recommendation.

# Quality of life

The evidence to the decision survey prior to voting showed that 100% of the CP considered the question a priority problem. For the desirable effects, 63.6% voted for large desirable effects and 63.6% voted for small undesirable effects of MRA. There was also a low certainty of evidence (72.7%), favoring comparison for balance of effects. The 36.4% voted for probably no important uncertainty/variability and 36.4% voted for possibly important uncertainty variability in how much people value the main outcomes. As to balance of effects, 36.4% voted for favoring the comparison considering the balance of effects. 63.6% voted for moderate costs which probably favor intervention for cost-effectiveness at 45.5%. 36.4% voted for probably reduced equity and the intervention is acceptable (54.5%) and feasible to implement (72.7%). The majority also voted that MRA use is feasible and acceptable. Majority of the CP (90.9%) voted to recommend treatment with strong strength of recommendation at 90.9%.

# Explanations

- a. Not a primary outcome and not powered to detect differences
- b. Number of events was small
- c. Wide confidence interval
- d. Most of the safety outcomes were assessed using descriptive statistics (frequency) only

The evidence to decision survey conducted prior to voting showed that the 81.8% of the CP considered it as a priority problem and measures to alleviate these epidemiological and economic burdens are imperative, especially those that will reduce cardiovascular outcomes. Majority (72.7%) voted for large desirable effects and small undesirable effects of SGLT2i. There was high certainty of evidence favoring comparison for balance of effects. There were no studies on the certainty of evidence of required costs. 54.5% of the CP voted for moderate costs probably favoring cost effectiveness of the intervention. 45.5% voted for possibly important uncertainty/variability with probably increased equity. The majority (81.8%) voted that SGLT2i is probably acceptable and 54.5% voted that it is feasible to implement. All members of the CP (100%) voted to recommend treatment; 90.9% of the CP voted to give the treatment a strong recommendation.

The evidence to decision survey prior to voting showed that the majority of the CP considered it as a priority problem. There was moderate desirability and a split vote on small vs trivial undesirable effect. There was moderate certainty of evidence, favoring intervention for balance of effects. The majority voted for large costs with no study on cost effectiveness. The majority voted for possibly important uncertainty/variability with probably increased equity. The vote was split between probably acceptable and acceptable. Referral was probably feasible. The entire CP (100%) voted to recommend referral while there was a 50-50 split between strong and weak during the vote regarding the strength of recommendation.
