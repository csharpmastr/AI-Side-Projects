# PHILIPPINE CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES

# for the Screening and Diagnosis of Obesity in Adults

As of October 5, 2023
---
# Executive Summary

The prevalence of obesity among Filipino adults continues to rise, putting more Filipinos at risk for non-communicable diseases. Persons who are overweight and obese present with unique risk factors and heightened predisposition for select disease; thus, early diagnosis is essential. This clinical practice guideline (CPG) aims to provide recommendations on the diagnosis of overweight and obesity and on the screening for obesity-related risk factors and health conditions among adults. Other aspects of management will not be covered in this guideline. It is intended to be used by general physicians and specialists, other healthcare professionals, policymakers to improve management among individuals with obesity. Its target beneficiaries are the patients with obesity, and indirectly the whole of society in the Philippines.

A Steering Committee, a Technical Working Group, a multi-sectoral Consensus Panel, and an oversight committee were involved in different stages of guideline development, following the methodology described in the Department of Health (DOH) CPG Manual 2018. The current guideline focuses on answering twelve clinical questions using current best available evidence from published research, local resources, and practice context. Recommendations were drafted by the evidence review experts and finalized by the Consensus Panel. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) method was used to determine the direction and strength of each recommendation.

Twelve recommendations were developed for the 12 clinical questions and their corresponding evidence summaries (Table 1). Of these, a majority were strong recommendations despite being based on low to very low certainty of evidence due to the benefits and feasibility of diagnosis and screening. Other recommendations require further research to improve our confidence in recommending these interventions for the management of adults with obesity.

# Introduction

# Background

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines overweight and obesity as an “abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health” [1]. More recently, the Obesity Medicine Association updated this definition and defines obesity as “a chronic, progressive, relapsing, and treatable multi-factorial, neurobehavioral disease, wherein an increase in body fat promotes adipose tissue dysfunction and abnormal fat mass physical forces, resulting in adverse metabolic, biomechanical, and psychosocial health consequences” [2]. It is a condition present in more than 1.9 billion adults (39%) worldwide as of 2016, and in about 36.6% of Filipino adults in 2019 [3,4]. Although believed to be a condition predominant in high-income countries, the prevalence of overweight and obesity continues to rise in low- and middle-income countries such as the Philippines where prevalence has nearly doubled since 1998. An individual can be classified as having overweight or obesity using simple anthropometric measures such as body mass index (BMI) and waist and hip circumference measurements. Standard values based on European populations have been used in the diagnosis of overweight and obesity, but in recent years, it has been proposed that Asian countries use cut-off levels distinct from other ethnicities due to their differing level of risk for non-communicable diseases [5–7].

Obesity results primarily from the imbalance between increased caloric intake and decreased caloric expenditure (e.g., overeating, low energy expenditure, physical inactivity), which are brought about by a variety of factors (including environmental, genetic, biologic, and social factors) [8,9]. Hypothyroidism, for example, is a common endocrine abnormality that contributes to weight gain through an unfavorable lipid profile, increased cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, and features of metabolic syndrome [10]. Medications for other conditions may also cause obesity and may negatively impact the efficacy of treatment [11].

Having overweight or obesity increases an individual’s risk for developing various non-communicable diseases. It is a component of metabolic syndrome, which includes other conditions: insulin resistance, atherogenic dyslipidemia, and elevated blood pressure [12]. Central obesity is also an independent risk factor associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and women with PCOS are more likely to have metabolic syndrome [13]. Increased adiposity surrounding the airways may lead to the development of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and increase the risk of adverse CV events [14]. Increased visceral adiposity also leads to lipolysis and the release of free fatty acids which accumulate in organs such as the liver [15]. Obesity could also lead to the development of other health conditions such as depression and osteoarthritis, both of which limit physical activity [16,17].

Given the increased risk of persons with obesity for several health conditions, the diagnosis of overweight or obesity and screening in this specific population are vital for early detection and early intervention. These, in turn, may prevent disease development or improve prognosis for certain conditions.

# Objectives

This CPG aims to define best practices in screening and diagnosis of obesity and its associated conditions among Filipino adults by conducting a comprehensive and systematic assessment of the benefit, harm, and cost of select screening and diagnostic tests.
---
# Scope and Purpose

This CPG covers the screening and diagnosis of obesity among non-pregnant adults, including screening tests, screening for risk factors, and determination of underlying etiology (Table 2). As obesity is a prevalent health condition among Filipino adults [4], it is necessary to set standards for screening and diagnosis of overweight and obesity based on the best available evidence.

Questions related to the treatment of obesity or questions on the pediatric population are not covered. Although interventions for select conditions covered in this CPG are mentioned in the evidence summaries as part of the screening cascade, they are not to be equated as the guideline developers’ recommended treatments. The guideline developers acknowledge that other management options may not have been covered by the evidence included in this CPG and that the evidence of the current review is not sufficient to recommend a particular course of management of any of the conditions covered in the CPG.

# Target Population

The majority of recommendations of this CPG will apply to non-pregnant adults who have overweight or obesity. Recommendations for children and adolescents are not covered by this CPG.

# Intended Users

This CPG is intended for use in the primary care setting by physicians, nurses, midwives, barangay health workers and other allied health professionals. The Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PHIC), payers and policymakers, including hospital administrators and employers, can also utilize this CPG.

# CPG Development Methodology

# Guideline Preparation

# Composition of the CPG Task Force

The Obesity CPG Task Force was composed of several committees: the Steering Committee, the conflict of interest (COI) review committee, the Technical Working Group, and the Consensus Panel (Appendix 1).

The Steering Committee is composed of representatives from multiple disciplines such as medical nutrition, endocrinology, cardiology, and family and community medicine. The Committee oversaw the guideline development from the formulation and clarification of review questions to the finalization of the CPG manuscript. The Steering Committee was also responsible for selecting members of the Consensus Panel and the Technical Working Group as guided by the stipulations in the DOH manual for CPG development [18]. The COI review committee reviewed the COIs of the selected members of the Obesity CPG Task Force and recommended strategies to manage the COIs related to the questions of the CPG to limit the bias introduced by COIs (see section on Management of Conflict of Interest).

The Technical Working Group was composed of a technical coordinator, evidence review experts, a technical facilitator, and a technical writer. The technical coordinator and evidence review experts were responsible for reviewing the available evidence for each review question covered by the CPG. The technical facilitator presided over en banc meetings and facilitated discussions between the Consensus Panel, the Steering Committee, and the Technical Working Group. A technical writer was present throughout the process to synthesize the results of these discussions and to draft the CPG manuscript.

Subject matter experts and other key stakeholders (including policymakers, patient advocates, allied medical practitioners, and physicians from public, private, and occupational health settings) were invited to join the Consensus Panel, which was represented by a total of fourteen organizations. The Panel, through the en banc meetings, provided their insights on the evidence presented and finalized the recommendations per review question.

# Evidence Synthesis

# Search Methods and Strategies

The evidence review experts conducted systematic searches of both local and international electronic databases (e.g., MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library and HERDIN). Text words and controlled vocabulary (e.g., MeSH) terms were used. The specific search strategy was dictated by the population, intervention, comparator, and outcome (PICO) specifications for each guideline question. See Appendix 2 for the final search strategies used for the evidence reviews.

# Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Existing systematic reviews with or without meta-analyses that matched the prespecified PICO were prioritized and evaluated for possible adaptation. For questions on screening, the evidence review experts searched for randomized trials of screening interventions that
---
# reported outcomes on benefit and/or harm. In the absence of direct evidence, indirect evidence on test accuracy and effectiveness of early treatment were sought. Preference was given to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) while observational studies (e.g., cohort studies) were considered appropriate when RCTs were unavailable. For diagnostic test accuracy, observational studies with the appropriate index test and reference standard that reported diagnostic performance (e.g., sensitivity, specificity) or enough information to derive these (e.g., 2x2 table) were included.

# Study Quality Assessment

Two evidence review experts independently appraised the methodological quality of each study. Existing CPGs with recommendations that were relevant to the current guideline questions were assessed using the AGREE-II instrument. The evidence bases of high-quality CPGs (overall AGREE-II score ≥75%, AND scaled domain score ≥80% for “Rigour of Development”) were adapted and updated. Primary studies were appraised using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized trials, Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort and case-control studies, QUADAS-2 for diagnostic test accuracy studies, or QUADAS-C for comparative test accuracy studies.

# Data Synthesis

Studies with sufficiently similar PICOs were pooled and the effect estimates were reported using RevMan 5.4. Measures of diagnostic performance (i.e., sensitivity, specificity) were pooled using STATA or R software. Heterogeneity was investigated using the Cochrane Q and I2 statistics. When quantitative synthesis was not possible, the results were discussed qualitatively in the narrative.

The appraisal of included studies in the review for each research question and the synthesis of their effect estimates for critical and important outcomes were presented in an evidence summary. The balance of benefits and risks became the basis for the draft recommendations. The evidence summaries were compiled into an evidence base that was submitted before the en banc meetings to guide in the decision-making process of the multi-sectoral Consensus Panel.

# Formulating Recommendations

# Certainty of Evidence and Strength of Recommendations

The GRADE approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence with the aid of GRADEPro, a web-based application that considers risk of bias, indirectness, imprecision, inconsistency, and other considerations (e.g., publication bias). The overall certainty of evidence was based on the lowest certainty rating among the top seven critical and important outcomes (Table 3). The rating of importance of outcomes into critical, important, or relevant was decided on by the multi-sectoral Consensus Panel.

19
---
|Certainty of Evidence|Interpretation|
|---|---|
|High|We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.|
|Moderate|We are moderately confident in the effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.|
|Low|Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited. The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.|
|Very Low|We have very little confidence in the effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.|

Factors that lower quality of the evidence are:

- Risk of bias
- Important inconsistency of results
- Some uncertainty about directness
- High probability of reporting bias
- Sparse data/Imprecision
- Publication bias

Additional factors that may increase quality are:

- All plausible residual confounding, if present, would reduce the observed effect
- Evidence of a dose-response gradient
- Large effect

# Patients’ Views and Preferences

The evidence review experts searched for studies that tackled the patients’ views and preferences on the intervention, including studies that described the impact of the intervention on equity, acceptability, and feasibility. The Consensus Panel was also encouraged to assess the intervention based on their experiences as key stakeholders, and to record their assessment on the acceptability equity, acceptability, and feasibility of the intervention in the Evidence-to-Decision (EtD) questionnaire.

# Resource Implications

The evidence review experts sought for evidence from cost-effectiveness studies on the resource implications associated with using the intervention. In the absence of cost-effectiveness studies, a summary of costs of the intervention offered in hospitals, laboratories, and pharmacies was included, if available.

# Rating of Outcomes

The Consensus Panel reviewed the evidence and the draft recommendations prepared by the Technical Working Group. Through an online survey, Panel members rated the relative importance of all outcomes for each research question in clinical decision-making. Each outcome was scored on a scale of 1–9 where outcomes scored from 1–3 were considered of limited importance, outcomes scored from 4–6 were important but not critical, and outcomes scored from 7–9 were considered critical.
---
# Consensus Process

# Consensus Panel Meetings

Evidence summaries were compiled into sets of evidence summaries and were sent to the Consensus Panel prior to each en banc meeting. Panel members were oriented on the CPG process and how to interpret the evidence. After reviewing the evidence summaries, the Panel was also asked to fill out an EtD questionnaire as part of their assessment.

**Table 4. Detailed considerations based on the Evidence-to-Decision framework [20]**
|1.|Is the problem a priority?|
|---|---|
|2.|How accurate is the test?|
|3.|How substantial are the desirable anticipated effects?|
|4.|How substantial are the undesirable anticipated effects?|
|5.|What is the certainty of the evidence of test accuracy?|
|6.|Is there important uncertainty about or variability in how much people value the main outcomes, including adverse effects and burden of the test and downstream outcomes of clinical management guided by the test results?|
|7.|Does the balance between desirable and undesirable effects favor the test or the comparison?|
|8.|How large are the resource requirements (costs)?|
|9.|What is the certainty of the evidence of resource requirements (costs)?|
|10.|Does the cost-effectiveness of the test favor the test or the comparison?|
|11.|What would be the impact on health equity?|
|12.|Is the test acceptable to key stakeholders?|
|13.|Is the test feasible to implement?|

Five virtual en banc meetings were held via Zoom video conferencing and were moderated by an expert technical facilitator. The evidence review experts presented the key findings for their assigned guideline questions, after which the Consensus Panel was given opportunities to clarify the evidence presented and to explain the rationale behind their assessments in the EtD. A summary of their responses to the EtD questionnaire was presented to guide the panelists during their discussions.

# Generation of recommendations

The Consensus Panel voted on the direction (i.e., for or against) and the strength (i.e., strong or weak) of the final recommendations based on the certainty of the evidence, the balance between benefits and harms, values, preferences, and burden on patients, cost and resource implications, equity, acceptability, and feasibility. Consensus was achieved when 75% of the voting Panel members agreed on the proposed recommendation or decision. A modified Delphi process was implemented when no consensus was reached after three rounds of nominal voting.

A standardized language was used in the wording of each recommendation. “For” was used if it was a positive recommendation for screening, and “against” was used if the recommendation was negative. Weak recommendations were worded as suggestions (i.e., “We suggest”), and strong recommendations began with “We recommend”. For each guideline question and recommendation, consensus issues or the narrative of the comments and feedback of the Consensus Panel were recorded by the technical writer for inclusion in the final manuscript.
---
# External Review

The CPG manuscript was externally reviewed by a clinical epidemiologist and methodology expert, a content expert clinician, and a non-content expert clinician using a modified AGREE-REX tool. Feedback from the external reviewers was considered by the Steering Committee and the technical coordinator prior to finalizing this manuscript.

# Editorial Independence

# • Funding Source

The CPG development was funded by the DOH and managed by the University of the Philippines Manila National Institutes of Health.

# • Management of Conflicts of Interest

All Task Force members submitted the following documents before initiating the guideline development process: a declaration of their COIs using the prescribed DOH form and the latest version of their curriculum vitae. The declaration covered their personal, potential, intellectual, and/or financial COI within the previous 4 years (Appendix 3). These documents were then reviewed by an independent COI Review Committee to determine the presence of any significant COIs and to recommend strategies to manage these. These strategies included broadcasting their COIs during Consensus Panel meetings (Status B), disallowing them from voting on certain questions (Status C), disallowing their participation in specific guideline questions (Status D, evidence review experts), and prohibition from participating in any part of the CPG (Status D, Steering Committee member, technical coordinator, or technical facilitator).

# Recommendation and Evidence Summaries

# Should we use the Asia-Pacific cut-off for BMI instead of WHO values to diagnose overweight and obesity among adult Filipinos?

Among adult Filipinos, we recommend the use of the Asia-Pacific criteria rather than the World Health Organization global criteria for body mass index to diagnose overweight and obesity. (Very low certainty of evidence, Strong recommendation)

NOTE: Asia-Pacific BMI cut-offs: ≥23.0 kg/m2 (overweight), ≥25.0 kg/m2 (obese)

# CONSENSUS ISSUES

The Consensus Panel recognizes the potential for mislabeling individuals as having overweight or obesity when using lower BMI cut-offs such as those specified under the WHO Asia-Pacific (WHO-APP) criteria. However, despite the very low certainty of evidence, the panelists decided on a strong recommendation because of the following considerations:

- There are low undesirable effects with using the WHO-APP BMI criteria.
- Early diagnosis of overweight or obesity provides opportunities to implement interventions to prevent the development of cardiometabolic conditions. Clinicians and healthcare providers must communicate the value of early interventions to improve future health outcomes.

# KEY FINDINGS

Two observational studies done among adult Filipino populations in Canada and USA investigated the association between the WHO-APP BMI thresholds for overweight and obesity and certain cardiometabolic diseases (hypertension and diabetes mellitus). A diagnosis of obesity using lower BMI cut-offs was associated with an increased likelihood of developing at least one cardiometabolic condition (OR 2.39 [95% CI 1.27, 4.47]). The diagnosis of overweight and obesity using the WHO-APP cut-off was associated with the development of hypertension (OR 2.63 [95% CI 1.52, 4.50] and 3.02 [95% CI 1.97, 4.61], respectively). Similarly, obesity is also a prognostic factor for having diabetes (OR 2.96 [95% CI 1.53, 4.50]). The overall certainty of evidence was downgraded to very low due to serious risk of bias, serious imprecision, and serious indirectness.

# BURDEN OF DISEASE

Overweight and obesity are characterized by an abnormal accumulation of adiposity in the body, leading to an increased risk for many noncommunicable diseases. As of 2019, a local survey by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute showed that approximately 27 million Filipinos were overweight or obese [4]. The prevalence of overweight and obesity among adults increased twofold from 20.2% in 1998 to 36.6% in 2019.

An individual can be classified as having overweight or obesity based on their BMI, which is the ratio between body weight in kilograms (kg) and height in squared meters (m2). A classification based on European populations has been developed, but it has been recommended that Asian Pacific populations use lower cut-offs due to increased risk for non-communicable diseases (i.e., WHO-APP) [5] (Table 5).

**Table 5. WHO and WHO-APP body mass index classification systems [5]**
|BMI Classification|WHO Cut-offs (kg/m2)|WHO-APP Cut-offs (kg/m2)|
|---|---|---|
|Underweight|&lt;18.5 kg/m2|&lt;18.5 kg/m2|
|Normal|18.5–24.9 kg/m2|18.5–22.9 kg/m2|
|Overweight|25–29.9 kg/m2|23–24.9 kg/m2|
|Obesity|³30 kg/m2|³25 kg/m2|

BMI body mass index, WHO World Health Organization, WHO-APP World Health Organization Asia-Pacific population

# PROGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE

Observational studies conducted in Canada (n=18,794) and the USA (n=382) among Filipino participants were included in this review (Table 6). The studies utilized different cut-off values for BMI, but both sets of cut-offs were lower than the standard BMI cut-offs of WHO based on European populations.

The risk of having at least one cardiometabolic condition (i.e., diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or CVD) was twice as high among Filipino-Canadian participants of the increased risk group (BMI 23–27.5 kg/m2) compared to the acceptable risk group (BMI 18.5–23 kg/m2; OR 2.12 [95% CI 0.98, 4.58]) [21]. The high-risk group (BMI ³27.5 kg/m2) also had an increased likelihood of developing cardiometabolic disease (OR 2.39 [95% CI 1.27, 4.47]).

There was no significant difference in the odds of having diabetes among Filipino-American women who were classified as overweight and those with normal BMI based on the WHO-APP cut-offs [22]. Patients with BMI ³25 kg/m2, who were classified as obese based on the WHO-APP cut-offs, had greater odds for diabetes mellitus, indicating a strong association with obesity (OR 2.96 [95% CI 1.53, 4.5]). Women classified as overweight also had increased odds of having hypertension (OR 2.63 [95% CI 1.52, 4.5]), while those classified as obese had even greater increase in odds (OR 3.02 [95% CI 1.97, 4.61]) [22]. Both cut-offs showed strong association with the development of hypertension.

The overall certainty of evidence was downgraded to very low due to serious risk of bias (lack of follow-up, which is necessary in assessment of evidence on prognosis), serious imprecision (some confidence intervals crossed the null value), and serious indirectness (from the recruitment of immigrant Filipino populations living in North America, who may have significantly varied dietary and lifestyle practices compared to Filipinos living in the Philippines).

# Should waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio in addition to body mass index be used in the assessment of adult Filipinos with overweight and obesity?

Among adult Filipinos, we suggest the use of waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio in addition to body mass index to diagnose obesity. (Very low certainty of evidence, Weak recommendation)

NOTE:

- Waist circumference cut-offs (obese): ≥90 cm (male), ≥80 cm (female)
- Waist-to-hip ratio cut-offs (obese): ≥1.0 (male), ≥0.85 (female)

# CONSENSUS ISSUES

The Consensus Panel acknowledges the value of using waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) in addition to BMI in diagnosing obesity. Having more parameters could better support a diagnosis of nutritional status. BMI alone may also not accurately diagnose obesity since it considers total body weight and not just adiposity. Patients may be amenable to having their waist circumference and WHR measurements taken, and they may already be aware of the value of and how to take these measurements. Incorporating waist circumference and WHR in obesity diagnosis may also broaden the perspective on diagnosing and treating obesity.

However, the Panel specifies the following considerations:

- Healthcare practitioners may consider a patient’s age, lifestyle, and physical activity when deciding on using these measurements as criteria for diagnosing obesity. Individuals who engage in resistance training may benefit from these measurements since they may have high muscle mass but low adiposity, which BMI will not be able to discriminate.
- The accuracy of waist circumference and WHR measurements relies on the placement of the measuring tape when taking these measurements (Appendix 4). Training is needed to ensure that healthcare practitioners can take accurate measurements.
- Taking waist circumference and WHR measurements may introduce slight inconvenience or discomfort to patients.

# KEY FINDINGS

There was no direct evidence on the use of waist circumference or WHR to screen for obesity in Filipino adults. The included cross-sectional study (n=332) compared the diagnostic utility of waist circumference, WHR and BMI in predicting risk for diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension among adult Filipinos. WHR best predicted the occurrence of diabetes, and waist circumference best predicted the presence of hypertension. Although dyslipidemia was predicted best by BMI among males, no index test was useful for detecting the condition among females. Waist circumference, WHR and BMI all had moderate sensitivity and specificity in predicting diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. However, the overall certainty of evidence is low due to indirectness, risk of bias from concerns regarding patient selection, and imprecision.

# BURDEN OF DISEASE

Central or abdominal obesity is a CVD risk factor independent of BMI, and it can be assessed using waist circumference and WHR, which is the ratio of waist circumference and hip circumference (the maximum circumference [in cm] around the buttocks posteriorly and pubic symphysis anteriorly). These anthropometric measurements can also be used as screening tools to estimate weight status in relation to possible risk of disease. Studies have shown that a higher waist circumference also leads to an increased risk for heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and mortality. Cut-offs for these measurements may also vary between populations (Table 8). To date, there are no validated cut-offs for waist circumference and WHR for adult Filipinos to diagnose obesity [27,28].

|Male|≥102 cm|≥1.0|≥90 cm|≥1.0|
|Female|≥88 cm|≥0.85|≥80 cm|≥0.85|

# DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE

A local cross-sectional study that assessed the ability of three index tests to predict diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia among Filipino adults (n=332) without known cardiometabolic diseases from a rural community was included in the review.

Diabetes was predicted best by WHR (males: AUC 0.67, females: AUC 0.70) and worst by BMI (males: AUC 0.53, females: AUC 0.55) [29] (Table 9). The presence of hypertension was best predicted by waist circumference and BMI (AUC 0.75 and 0.74, respectively) in males, and by waist circumference and WHR (AUC 0.59 and 0.58, respectively) in females. On the other hand, BMI predicted the occurrence of dyslipidemia the best among males (AUC 0.59), while none of the tests were useful for detecting dyslipidemia in females.

The index tests achieved moderate sensitivity and moderate specificity in predicting diabetes [29] (Table 10). A high WHR increased the odds of diabetes by 50%, while a normal WHR decreased the odds by 35%. High waist circumference was found to raise the odds of diabetes by 37%, whereas a normal waist circumference lowered the odds by 24%. Lastly, having a BMI of ≥23 lead to greater odds of diabetes by 13%, while a normal BMI had lowered odds by 14%.
---
In predicting hypertension, the three index tests demonstrated moderate sensitivity and moderate specificity [29] (Table 10). A high waist circumference increased the odds of hypertension by 28%, and a normal waist circumference led to lowering the odds by 17%. Higher WHR lead to higher odds of hypertension by 16%, while a normal WHR reduced the odds by 11%. A high BMI resulted in raised odds of hypertension by 25%, while a normal BMI decreased the odds by 22%.

The index tests also had moderate sensitivity and moderate specificity in the prediction of dyslipidemia [29] (Table 10). Having a high waist circumference was shown to lower the odds of dyslipidemia by 11%, whereas a normal waist circumference increased the odds by 9%. The odds of dyslipidemia decreased by 11% when WHR was high, but the odds increased by 11% when WHR was normal. Finally, having a high BMI raised the odds of dyslipidemia by 10%, but the odds decreased by 9% when BMI was normal.

The certainty of evidence was downgraded due to risk of bias and to imprecision because of the wide confidence intervals. The included study had a moderate risk of bias due to possible selection bias (healthy volunteer effect). The QUADAS-2 and QUADAS-C tools were used in the assessment, with noted high risk of bias in the domain of patient selection.

# COST IMPLICATION

There were no local cost-effectiveness studies found on the use of waist circumference or WHR in screening for obesity, but the overall estimated cost of screening using these index tests is expected to be low. Treatment for obesity includes lifestyle interventions (e.g., low caloric diet, reduced dietary fat and carbohydrates, increased physical activity), pharmacologic therapy with orlistat (up to 3 times/day for PHP 100.00–150.00)*, or bariatric surgery (≥PHP 80,000.00)* in extreme cases with metabolic complications.

*Costs as of the writing of this CPG

# EQUITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND FEASIBILITY

Despite the established risks for cardiometabolic diseases associated with obesity, there are still high rates of nonadherence to lifestyle and behavior modification. Some barriers to lifestyle modification include poor motivation, lack of time, environmental, societal, and social pressures, health and physical limitations, negative thoughts/moods, socioeconomic constraints, and lack of enjoyment of exercise. In the Philippines, there is also a lack of trained professionals to administer behavioral therapy. Meanwhile, the predictors of adherence to lifestyle modification included early weight loss success, lower BMI, better baseline mood, being male and older age.

A local study by De Roxas assessed the experiences of six adult Filipinos regarding obesity via interviews. The study showed that obesity had negative consequences on the subjects physically and socially, but that the subjects had adaptive coping mechanisms to obesity. The study concluded that “the physical, the psychological and social consequences of obesity experienced by Filipinos called for a need of a special psychological intervention.” However, the full copy of the paper could not be retrieved and was not available for full review.

# Should we screen for hypothyroidism as an underlying cause using TSH among adult Filipinos with obesity?

Among adult Filipinos, we suggest screening for hypothyroidism using thyroid-stimulating hormone among adults aged ≤70 years old at the initial visit. (Very low certainty of evidence, Weak recommendation)

# CONSENSUS ISSUES

The Consensus Panel acknowledges that screening for hypothyroidism using thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurements may be acceptable to patients since it is easy to perform, would not require much preparation on the part of the patient, and results in minimal harmful effects on the individual. However, a weak recommendation was given due to the following considerations:

- Aside from obesity, there are other clinical signs and symptoms that may be used in assessing the likelihood of having hypothyroidism.
- Screening may encourage treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism. However, there was no conclusive evidence on the benefits of early treatment.
- Other blood tests (e.g., cardiometabolic assessments) should be prioritized.

# KEY FINDINGS

There is no direct evidence on the effectiveness of screening for hypothyroidism among adults with obesity. An RCT on screening with TSH and free thyroxine (FT4) among pregnant women (n=135; mean age 41.2 [SD 5.3] years old) found no significant difference in change in BMI, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides compared to no screening. In another six RCTs among pregnant women with hypothyroidism (n=2,531), levothyroxine treatment was found to reduce the likelihood of pregnancy losses. Levothyroxine treatment also decreased the likelihood of CV events in younger patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, but not among older patients with the same condition (n=7,778). The occurrence of any serious adverse events (SAEs) was not significantly associated with levothyroxine treatment among elderly adults with subclinical hypothyroidism. There was no significant difference in the risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation and fracture. The overall certainty of evidence was very low due to indirectness in population, imprecision, and reliance on observational studies.

# BURDEN OF DISEASE

Hypothyroidism is one of the most common endocrine abnormalities, and it is associated with dyslipidemia, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and increased CV events [37]. Symptoms of hypothyroidism are typically vague, often difficult to recognize, and can be easily confused with those of obesity [10]. Moreover, the co-existence of obesity and hypothyroidism is common. A recent meta-analysis estimated that the prevalence of hypothyroidism among persons with obesity was 14.0% (95% CI 9.7, 18.9) [38]. Locally, the PHILTIDES study revealed that the prevalence of overt hypothyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism in the general population is 0.41% and 2.18%, respectively [39]. Because hypothyroidism is considered a secondary cause of obesity [40], higher estimates are likely present among this specific population.

TSH is the best screening test for thyroid dysfunction for most clinical situations, such that normal TSH is enough to rule out primary hypothyroidism [41]. Primary hypothyroidism is presently defined as TSH concentrations above the reference range and FT4 concentrations below the reference range. Mild or subclinical hypothyroidism, which is commonly regarded as a sign of early thyroid failure, is defined by TSH concentrations above the reference range and FT4 concentrations within the normal range [42].

Given the high prevalence of hypothyroidism among individuals with obesity, several international guidelines recommend that all patients with obesity should be considered for thyroid hormone level testing [30,43–46]. However, there is still paucity of high-quality prospective studies to support the benefit of screening. Treatment of hypothyroidism as a secondary cause of obesity is postulated to improve weight by raising the basal metabolic rate and reducing water retention [47]. Improvement of weight and lipid parameters can potentially improve CV outcomes even among patients with obesity who are even at a higher risk [48].

# BENEFITS AND HARMS

An RCT found that hypothyroidism screening with TSH and FT4 in pregnant women resulted in a greater reduction in BMI compared to no screening, but this was not statistically significant [49] (Table 12). Change in HDL cholesterol (MD 0 mmol/L [95% CI -0.335, 0.335]) and triglyceride levels (MD 0.21 mmol/L [95% CI -0.35, 0.1]) was similar in both groups.

Indirect evidence from trials on pregnant adults with hypothyroidism showed that treatment with levothyroxine reduced the risk of pregnancy loss (OR 0.34 [95% CI 0.23, 0.52]) [50] (Table 12). Levothyroxine treatment in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism was associated with a lower risk of CV events among younger patients (≤70 years old) but not in older patients (≥65 years old) (OR 0.61 [95% CI 0.39, 0.95] and OR 1.13 [95% CI 0.96, 1.34], respectively) [51,52]. The occurrence of any SAEs was not significantly associated with levothyroxine treatment among elderly adults with subclinical hypothyroidism. There was no significant difference in the risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation and [53].

The overall certainty of evidence is very low. The certainty of evidence was downgraded due to indirectness in population (non-obese and/or pregnant adults) and imprecision.

# Should we screen for polycystic ovary syndrome among reproductive-aged Filipino adult women with obesity?

Among adult reproductive-aged Filipino women with obesity, we recommend screening for polycystic ovarian syndrome using the Rotterdam criteria at the initial visit. (Low certainty of evidence, Strong recommendation)

# CONSENSUS ISSUES

Despite the low certainty of evidence, a strong recommendation was given to screen for PCOS based on the following considerations:

- There is no substantial evidence on the prevalence of PCOS among persons with obesity and vice versa. However, based on clinical experience, PCOS is one of the top consultations received by obstetricians and gynecologists and these patients were often with obesity.
- Patients would greatly benefit from early detection and early treatment for PCOS since it is a lifelong condition that is often diagnosed late.
- Although not covered in the review, lifestyle changes are first considered for treatment of PCOS due to their effectiveness across various health outcomes.

The Consensus Panel also acknowledges the following:

- While obesity is common among patients with PCOS, it is not a risk factor that would trigger the assessment of PCOS.
- Increasing awareness at an earlier reproductive age may also facilitate early detection of PCOS.

# KEY FINDINGS

There was no direct evidence investigating the effectiveness of screening compared to no screening for PCOS among reproductive-aged Filipino adult women with obesity. RCTs on the treatment of PCOS among reproductive-aged adults with obesity found that the use of metformin compared to placebo significantly increased pregnancy rates (RR 1.62 [95% CI 1.16, 2.25]) and reduced fasting blood sugar (FBS) (MD -4.44 mg/dL [95% CI -7.00, -1.88]). Metformin was also found to be as good as or better than placebo in improving menstrual frequency (RR 1.25 [95% CI 0.98, 1.61]). On the other hand, use of oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) significantly increased quality of life. There were significantly more gastrointestinal side effects observed in patients who received metformin compared to placebo (RR 3.39 [95% CI 0.97, 11.90]). These include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and flatulence. In addition, there were more cases of headache, breast pain, dysmenorrhea, abnormal uterine bleeding, and hot flashes with OCP use compared to placebo. The overall certainty of evidence was very low due to serious risk of bias, indirectness, and imprecision from small trials.

# BURDEN OF DISEASE

PCOS can be diagnosed using the Rotterdam criteria based on (a) a history of menstrual irregularity, and (b) clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism signs such as acne, hirsutism, and/or male-pattern hair loss, and (c) ultrasonography findings of polycystic ovaries. To diagnose PCOS, the two out of the three criteria must be met, excluding other causes [55] (Table 14).

**Table 14. Rotterdam classification criteria for polycystic ovary syndrome [56,57]**
|Oligo-anovulation|Hyperandrogenism|Polycystic ovaries|
|---|---|---|
|• Bleeding interval &lt;21 days|• Clinical:|• ≥12 follicles, 2-9 mm in diameter|
|• Bleeding interval &gt;35 days, &lt;8 episodes of menses/year|Hirsutism (modified Ferriman-Gallwey score ≥8), acne, male-pattern alopecia|• Ovarian volume &gt;10 mL in one ovary|
|• Infertility|• Biochemical| |
|• No menstruation for 3 consecutive months in the last 12 months|Elevated total testosterone or free testosterone, elevated androstenedione, elevated dehydroepiandrosterone, elevated dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate| |

# BENEFITS AND HARMS

Studies on the effect of medical treatment by metformin or OCPs compared to placebo among obese adult patients diagnosed with PCOS were included in this review. Eighteen RCTs compared metformin (1,500–2,000 mg per day, for 35 days–12 months) to placebo among patients with obesity (n=979), and three RCTs studied the use of OCPs (ethinyl estradiol combined with desogestrel, norethindronate or cyproterone acetate) among patients with obesity (n=132).

The use of metformin was as good as or better than placebo for improving menstrual frequency or regularity (RR 1.25 [95% CI 0.98, 1.61]) [58–61], and it significantly increased pregnancy rate across six RCTs (RR 1.62 [95% CI 1.16, 2.25]) [62–67] (Table 15). Metformin use also resulted in a significantly decreased FBS (MD -4.44 mg/dL [95% CI -7.00, -1.88]) [58,65,67–72], but its benefit was inconclusive for hyperandrogenism (based on Ferriman-Galleway scores) [68,69] and for both systolic and diastolic blood pressure [58,60,65]. However, there were significantly more gastrointestinal side effects observed in patients who received metformin compared to placebo (RR 3.39 [95% CI 0.97, 11.90]) [61,63,70,73,74]. These include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and flatulence.

The benefit of OCPs compared to placebo was inconclusive for the following outcomes: hyperadrogenism, pregnancy rate, FBS, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure [75,76]. However, the use of OCPs significantly improved quality of life on the domains of emotion, hair, menstruation, and weight using the Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Quality of Life questionnaire (Table 15). In addition, there were more cases of headache, breast pain, dysmenorrhea, abnormal uterine bleeding, and hot flashes with OCP use compared to placebo.

The overall certainty of evidence for included studies on metformin compared to placebo was downgraded to low due to serious risk of bias and imprecision (low event rate) across different outcomes. The overall certainty of evidence for included studies on OCP compared to placebo was downgraded to low due to indirectness and imprecision (low event rate) across different outcomes.

# EQUITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND FEASIBILITY

In a qualitative study of women diagnosed with PCOS using the Rotterdam criteria, pain, and discomfort (27.6%) were the most common complaints, followed by hair loss and growth (16.2%) and menstrual irregularity (15.8%) [78]. Weight gain and bloating are also common concerns (12.1%), but are ranked as the most bothersome by patients (9.6/10), followed by infertility and problems in reducing weight. Weight and signs of hirsutism were also correlated with lower quality of life scores [79]. Additionally, the impact on emotional functioning includes depression, worry, anxiety, embarrassment, and frustration, as well as the effect on family and intimate relationships [78].

# Strength of Recommendation/Group (Year)

# Recommendation

# Metformin in addition to lifestyle, could be recommended in adult women with PCOS, for the treatment of weight, hormonal and metabolic outcomes.

Certainty of Evidence: Conditional, Low

# Metformin in addition to lifestyle, should be considered in adult women with PCOS with BMI ≥25 kg/m2 for management of weight and metabolic outcomes.

Certainty of Evidence: Conditional, Low

# Metformin could be used alone in women with PCOS, with anovulatory infertility and no other infertility factors, to improve ovulation, pregnancy and live birth rates, although women should be informed that there are more effective ovulation induction agents.

Certainty of Evidence: Conditional, Moderate

# Endocrine Society (2013) [81]

# We suggest that the diagnosis of PCOS be made if two of the three following criteria are met: androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction, or PCO, whereas disorders that mimic the clinical features of PCOS are excluded.

Certainty of Evidence: Weak, Moderate

# Women with PCOS are at increased risk of anovulation and infertility; in the absence of anovulation, the risk of infertility is uncertain. We recommend screening ovulatory status using menstrual history in all women with PCOS seeking fertility.

Certainty of Evidence: Strong, Low

# Should we screen for dysglycemia using a 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test among adult Filipinos with obesity?

Among adult Filipinos with obesity, we suggest screening for dysglycemia using 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test once a year. (Very low certainty of evidence, Weak recommendation)

# CONSENSUS ISSUES

Given the very low certainty of evidence, the Consensus Panel agreed on a weak recommendation for using the 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to screen for dysglycemia. However, the Panel members emphasized that aside from pharmacologic and surgical interventions, there is also evidence pointing to the effectiveness of lifestyle modifications (e.g., exercise and nutrition coaching programs) to address dysglycemia, which would increase the downstream benefits of screening among individuals with obesity.

# KEY FINDINGS

The review found no direct RCTs on the use of the 75-gm OGTT to screen adults with obesity for dysglycemia. The included studies investigated the effect of hypoglycemic agents and bariatric surgery as management for adults with obesity and with dysglycemia. Hypoglycemic agents such as metformin, liraglutide, and pioglitazone decreased the incidence of diabetes mellitus (RR 0.41 [95% CI 0.19, 0.88], I2=92%), but did not show significant effect on CVD incidence. Data from two RCTs on the effect of hypoglycemic agents on lipid profile could not be pooled, but one trial reported a significant decrease in total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) after using liraglutide, and the other reported no significant differences in triglycerides after using pioglitazone. Bariatric surgery significantly lowered the incidence of diabetes mellitus when compared to no surgery (RR 0.05 [95% CI 0.01, 0.27]).

# BURDEN OF DISEASE

Dysglycemia (an impaired glucose tolerance and/or impaired fasting glucose) [82] and type 2 diabetes mellitus exist as a continuum that burdens obese patients globally. Among overweight and obese patients, screening for dysglycemia provides an opportunity for clinicians to institute interventions early for primary prevention of diabetes and other complications associated with this chronic disease.

The 75-gm OGTT is used for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. However, it can also be used to detect individuals with prediabetes. Generally, recommendations consider OGTT as equally appropriate as FBS and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) testing for screening among adults [82–84]. However, using OGTT leads to greater accuracy of diabetes detection with a sensitivity of 90–93% and a specificity of 100% [85]. Among patients with overweight and obesity, screening for dysglycemia provides an opportunity for clinicians to institute interventions early for primary prevention of diabetes mellitus and other complications associated with this chronic disease.

# BENEFITS AND HARMS

Based on three RCTs, use of hypoglycemic agents (e.g., metformin, liraglutide, pioglitazone) compared to placebo reduced the incidence of diabetes mellitus (RR 0.41 [95% CI 0.19, 0.88]) (Table 18), but there was significant heterogeneity possibly due to different agents used (I2= 92%) [86–88]. Bariatric surgery also significantly lowered the incidence of diabetes mellitus compared to no surgery (RR 0.05 [95% CI 0.01, 0.26]; I2=0%) based on data from two non-randomized trials [89,90].

Two RCTs reported on change in lipid profile. One small RCT reported a significant decrease in total cholesterol (mean 172.2 mg/dL vs. 185.9 mg/dL, p<0.001), triglycerides (mean 127.8 mg/dL vs. 135.1 mg/dL, p<0.001), and LDL (mean 99.7 mg/dL vs. 112.3 mg/dL, p<0.001) after 14 weeks of liraglutide versus placebo [91] (Table 18). However, a larger RCT reported no significant difference in the decrease in triglycerides between pioglitazone and placebo [88]. Neither pioglitazone nor placebo altered levels of LDL, and no data on change in total cholesterol were reported. Pooling was not done due to inadequate data provided. There was also no significant difference in the incidence of CVD, which was defined as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or congestive heart failure [86,88].

# Three RCTs reported on SAEs with the use of hypoglycemic agents versus placebo.

One RCT noted more adverse events with pioglitazone (RR 1.23 [95% CI 1.03, 1.47]), including fractures (3% vs. 2.6%) [88]. Another large, multi-center RCT reported increased incidence of cholelithiasis, cholecystitis and pancreatitis with liraglutide compared to placebo [86]. Non-SAEs (gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, flatulence, nausea, and vomiting) were reported with metformin use [87]. Data was not pooled due to inadequate data provided. Adverse events associated with bariatric surgery compared to no surgery in obese patients with dysglycemia were not reported.

# OGTT Risks

OGTT is associated with minimal risks. The glucose solution can cause nausea, vomiting, bloating or headache. Venipuncture may cause excessive bleeding, hematoma, lightheadedness, infection, and multiple punctures [92].

# Risk of Bias in Studies

Of the six included studies, two studies had an overall high risk of bias due to lack of blinding of surgical intervention, leading to selection and performance bias. The study by Ariel et al. [91] had high risk of attrition bias. Three studies have overall some risks of bias. The study by le Roux et al. [86] had unclear risk for attrition bias, the study by Knowler et al. [87] had unclear risk for selection, performance and detection bias, and the study by DeFronzo et al. [88] had unclear risk for detection and reporting bias.

Three studies involved a small number of the population [89–91], while two studies had small number of events for one outcome measure [86,88]. The certainty of evidence was downgraded to very low because of serious risk of bias, indirectness to the research question, and imprecision across different critical outcomes.

# COST IMPLICATION

There are no local cost-effectiveness studies on dysglycemia screening among individuals with obesity. However, a study done in the United States among adults with overweight or obesity have shown screening for pre-diabetes and treating those identified as having impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glucose is cost-effective relative to no screening [93].

The cost for OGTT is considerably higher compared to FBS and HbA1c [94,95] (Table 19). Treatment cost for diabetes mellitus in the Philippines ranged from a mean (SD) of USD 454.00 (1,253.00) and USD 2,973.00 (6,166.00) based on a review of electronic hospital records in two tertiary hospitals in the Philippines and on cross-sectional survey of physicians providing outpatient care for people with diabetes mellitus [96]. Bariatric surgery in the Philippines (excluding pre-operative evaluation and healthcare professional fees) costs an average of USD 4,000.00 (equivalent to PHP 191,409.00 as of October 2021). PHIC provides reimbursement for bariatric procedures, while private insurance providers in the country do not provide coverage for such procedures [97].

# EQUITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND FEASIBILITY

Saleh Mshelia et al. (2021) reported that the OGTT, being more costly, time-consuming, and cumbersome, makes the test a less common choice among patients as screening for dysglycemia [98]. Reproducibility of the test is also an issue as glucose values after 75-gm glucose loading may be influenced by insulin sensitivity, enteric hormones, and responses to nutrient ingestion, such as gastrointestinal motility and emptying [99,100]. FBS has been recommended by the American Diabetes Association Expert Committee because of its ease of administration, convenience, acceptability to patients, and lower costs [98]. HbA1c does not require a fasting state compared with OGTT and FBS and has been used for monitoring glycemic control over a 3-month period.

# Should we screen for dyslipidemia using a fasting lipid profile among adult Filipinos with obesity?

Among adult Filipinos with obesity, we recommend screening for dyslipidemia using a fasting lipid profile. (Very low certainty of evidence, Strong recommendation)

# CONSENSUS ISSUES

Despite the very low overall certainty of evidence, the Panel decided on a strong recommendation given the long-term consequences of obesity and dyslipidemia including adverse CV outcomes. They also recognize that screening provides an opportunity for early intervention. Majority of the panelists (58%) favored annual over semiannual screening after a two-round modified Delphi activity mainly due to the costs incurred with more frequent testing.

# KEY FINDINGS

There was no direct evidence on lipid screening versus no lipid screening among adults with obesity. The included studies investigated the effectiveness of management among patients with obesity and with dyslipidemia. Eight RCTs looked into the effect of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on patients with obesity. Patients with obesity in the DASH group had better quality of life scores and greater reductions in serum aspartate transferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels. The DASH intervention also resulted in a significantly greater decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. No adverse events were reported in both DASH diet and usual diet groups. Overall, the certainty of evidence was very low due to reliance on indirect evidence, issues on allocation concealment and incomplete outcome reporting, as well as imprecision of effect estimates.

# BURDEN OF DISEASE

Obesity is a prominent component of the metabolic syndrome, along with atherogenic dyslipidemia, which manifests as elevated serum triglycerides >150 mg/dL and HDL<35 mg/dL. Metabolic syndrome increases the risk of diabetes and its complications, and it predisposes an individual to develop CVD [12]. One of the non-pharmacological approaches to address the metabolic syndrome is the DASH diet. It was created in the 1990s and has since then been used to control hypertension and other metabolic conditions. The diet is usually composed of seven servings of carbohydrates, two servings of low-fat dairy products, at most two servings of lean red meat, five servings of vegetables, and five servings of fruits, with two or three weekly servings of nuts and seeds [102].

# BENEFITS AND HARMS

One RCT reported that obese patients with heart failure in the DASH group had better quality of life scores using the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire at 3-month follow-up (mean score 21 vs. 39 points; p=0.006) [103] (Table 21). Among overweight and obese adults with NAFLD, consuming a DASH-type diet for 8 weeks demonstrated greater reductions in AST (MD -10.7 ± 25.1 IU/L vs. MD -1.6 ± 9.6 IU/L), ALT (MD -8.4 ± 16.5 IU/L vs. MD 3.8 ± 23.8 IU/L) and ALP (MD -26.3 ± 36.1 U/L vs. MD 4.3 ± 34.1 U/L) compared to the control group [104]. The pooled result from two RCTs (n=180) showed also that there was a significant decrease in both systolic (MD -3 mmHg [95% CI -3.93, -2.07]; I2=0%) and diastolic blood pressure (MD -4.24 mmHg [95% CI -7.94, -0.54]; p=0.02; I2=96%) among the obese patients on the DASH diet intervention [105,106].

However, meta-analyses on three RCTs (n=108) showed that the DASH diet did not significantly change total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL cholesterol levels [105,107,108]. The DASH diet resulted in lower HDL cholesterol levels when compared to a usual diet (MD -1.30 mg/dL [95% CI -2.18, -0.42]; I2=15%) [105,107,108] (Table 21). A meta-analysis of four RCTs (n=224) revealed no significant effect of DASH diet in fasting plasma glucose [106–109].

There were no reported adverse events or outcomes among the patients in the DASH diet intervention or usual diet intervention in the included RCTs.

The included trials were of moderate to high risk of bias due to unclear allocation concealment, lack of blinding and incomplete outcome data. The certainty of evidence was also downgraded due to indirectness and imprecision with wide confidence intervals. Overall, the certainty of evidence was very low across the different critical outcomes.

Screening for lipid disorders using a fasting lipid profile was more cost-effective than not screening but may be more expensive for subpopulations with other comorbidities and adverse effects related to treatment [110,111]. However, among the elderly, screening for dyslipidemia may be more costly due to other co-morbidities and adverse effects related to treatment [110]. The costs associated with dyslipidemia screening are summarized in Table 22.

|Parameter|Screening Intervention|Cost|
|---|---|---|
|Unit cost of screening intervention|Lipid profile|PHP 445.00 [112]|
|Other direct costs associated with the implementation of the proposed screening intervention|Initial and follow-up outpatient consultations with primary care physicians or specialists|2 x (PHP 500.00–1,000.00) = PHP 1,000.00–2,000.00|
| |Initial and follow-up outpatient consultations with nutritionist dietician|2 x (PHP 400.00–800.00) = PHP 800–1,600.00|
| |Meal Plan|PHP 1,000.00|
|Annual screening cost per patient| |PHP 3,245.00–5,045.00|

A cost-effectiveness study found that the DASH diet program had lower incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) than low-fat diet programs [AUS 12,000.00 (PHP 439,505.00)/DALY vs. AUS 13,000.00 (PHP 476,131.00)/DALY] [113]. Items on the DASH diet were also more available but more expensive in stores with higher socioeconomic status [75%; USD 40.20 (PHP 2,203.00) per person per week) vs. 46%; USD 30.73 (PHP 1,685.00) per person per week] [114].

# EQUITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND FEASIBILITY

The barriers to adopting the DASH diet among African Americans of low socioeconomic status are similar to what may be experienced in the local setting. These include the availability of fruits, vegetables and lean meat; limitations in food storage; possible disagreement with other family members regarding food choices; and uncommon food items or food preparation techniques [115]. Compliance to the DASH diet was observed to be lower among individuals with the lowest economic accessibility to supermarkets (OR 0.59 [95% CI 0.52, 0.68]) after adjusting for key demographics and exposure to other food outlets [116].

# Should we screen for hypertension among adult Filipinos with obesity?

Among adult Filipinos with obesity, we recommend screening for hypertension using a non-invasive blood pressure measurement with an appropriately-sized cuff at least once a year. (Very low certainty of evidence, Strong recommendation)

# CONSENSUS ISSUES

Despite the very low certainty of evidence, the Consensus Panel voted for a strong recommendation due to the benefits of early detection and early interventions for hypertension.

# KEY FINDINGS

No direct evidence was found on the effect of screening for hypertension using history and physical examination. Pooled diagnostic accuracy estimates based on data from six cross-sectional studies showed that measuring blood pressure using a correctly fitted blood pressure cuff among adults had a high sensitivity (87% [95% CI 79, 93]) and a high specificity (85% [95% CI 64, 95]).

Indirect evidence also came from four diagnostic cross-sectional studies and 24 RCTs on treatment with anti-hypertensives. Increased adverse events were observed that were attributable to antihypertensives. Intensive blood pressure lowering also had no significant effect on mortality and CVD. However, antihypertensives reduced the risk of stroke (HR 0.62 [95% CI 0.41, 0.94]; RR 0.63 [95% CI 0.49, 0.81]) and diabetes mellitus (HR 0.83 [95% CI 0.72, 0.95] among BMI 30–34.9 kg/m2; HR 0.79 [95% CI 0.63, 0.99] among BMI ≥35 kg/m2). Overall, the certainty of evidence was very low due to risk of bias (randomization and allocation sequence issues), indirectness and imprecision.

# BURDEN OF DISEASE

In individuals who become obese in early adulthood, there is a threefold risk of developing hypertension; this risk is still observed if obesity develops later in life [117]. The mechanisms of obesity-related hypertension encompass overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system, stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, functional changes in the kidneys, and changes in leptin levels and insulin resistance [118].

Hypertension, as defined in most international guidelines, corresponds to a properly taken office blood pressure reading of ≥140/90 (Appendix 4) [119]. Non-invasive blood pressure measurement is usually a quick and straightforward procedure, but blood pressure measurement in individuals with obesity may be affected by the cuff and bladder size of the sphygmomanometer [120]. The recommended cuff bladder dimensions are a length of 75–100% of the patient’s measured arm circumference, a width of 37–50% of the patient’s arm circumference, and a length-to-width ratio of 2:1 [121].

**Table 24. Recommended cuff sizes based on arm circumference [122]**
|Arm Circumference (cm)|Recommended Cuff Size (width x length in cm)|
|---|---|
|22–26|12 x 22 (small adult)|
|27–34|16 x 30 (adult)|
|35–44|16 x 36 (large adult)|
|45–52|16 x 42 (extra-large adult)|

Blood pressure control aims to reduce the risk of hypertension-related complications, leading to reduction of mortality in the long term. To achieve this, patients with obesity and hypertension are more likely to need more medications to control their blood pressure, compared to patients who are lean [123]. Lifestyle therapy, consisting of nutritional management and regular physical activity, is a consistent recommendation in the treatment of both hypertension and obesity. A 5–15% weight loss is recommended to achieve clinically meaningful effects, including reduction in blood pressure and in the number and/or doses of medications needed to control hypertension [13].

# BENEFITS AND HARMS

Two RCTs on the effect of anti-hypertensive medications on patients with obesity and one meta-analysis on the effect of anti-hypertensive medications on new-onset diabetes mellitus were assessed.

With intensive blood pressure-lowering therapy, there was no significant difference in the incidence of mortality and CVD (stroke, CVD death and non-fatal myocardial infarction) [124]. Meanwhile, anti-hypertensive use reduced the risk of stroke by almost 40% in two trials (HR 0.62 [95% CI 0.49, 0.94]; RR 0.63 [95% CI 0.49, 0.81]) [124,125].

Each 5-mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure was found to reduce the risk for diabetes by 11% (HR 0.89 [95% CI 0.84, 0.95]) [126].

Angiotensin-converting enzyme-I inhibitors (HR 0.84 [95% CI 0.76, 0.92]) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (HR 0.84 [95% CI 0.76, 0.93]) both reduced the risk for diabetes compared to placebo, while calcium channel blockers had no significant effect. Beta blockers (1.48 [95% CI 1.27, 1.72]) and thiazide diuretics (1.20 [95% CI 1.07, 1.35]) were found to increase the risk for diabetes. Focusing on the obese subgroups, a 5-mmHg reduction in blood pressure also resulted in lower risk of diabetes (BMI 30.0–34.9: HR 0.83 (95% CI 0.72, 0.95); BMI ≥35: HR 0.79 [95% CI 0.63, 0.99]).
---
In the ACCORD trial, there were more SAEs attributable to anti-hypertensives (e.g., hypotension, syncope, bradycardia) in the intensive therapy group (3.3% vs. 1.27%, p&lt;0.001) [127]. The incidence of reduced glomerular filtration rate to &lt;30 mL/min/1.73m2 was higher in the intensive blood pressure-lowering group (4.2% vs. 2.2%, p&lt;0.001).

The studies had moderate to high risk of bias due to unclear randomization and allocation sequence concealment. We also downgraded due to imprecise estimates for mortality and CVD, and indirectness (not a direct trial of screening, inclusion of participants without obesity).

# DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE

Data from a meta-analysis on the diagnostic accuracy of blood pressure measurements among patients with obesity was included in this review. The pooled sensitivity for non-invasive blood pressure determination using a correctly fitting blood pressure cuff in adults with obesity was 87% (95% CI 0.79, 0.93), and pooled specificity was 85% (95% CI 0.64, 0.95) [128] (Table 26). No statistical heterogeneity was detected (p=0.24). The certainty of evidence for the diagnostic accuracy of a properly fitting blood pressure cuff was downgraded due to issues of patient selection and the timing of the index test and reference standard as well as a wide interval estimate for specificity.

# COST IMPLICATION

Screening for hypertension by history entails no additional cost to the patient or to the physician. Blood pressure determination is a standard component of routine physical examination. Properly fitting cuffs for blood pressure determination in a patient with obesity entails additional cost to the physician, clinic, or hospital (Table 27).

# EQUITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND FEASIBILITY

A nationwide survey of blood pressure, anthropometric measurements, risk factors, and comorbidity assessment conducted in January to April 2021 found an increasing trend in the prevalence of hypertension (37%) and a modest proportion with good blood pressure control (39%). Among the patients with hypertension, the average BMI was 26.4 kg/m2 and concomitant CV risk factors (smoking, diabetes, angina) were also prevalent. Because only 52% of the patients with hypertension had personal awareness of having the disease, awareness and screening programs remain relevant in CVD prevention strategies for our population [129]. A study on the acceptability of home, kiosk, and clinic blood pressure measurement compared to 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in the US showed best overall acceptability and adherence scores for home blood pressure followed by clinic measurement [130].

# Should we screen for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis among adult Filipinos with obesity?

Among adult Filipinos with obesity, we suggest screening for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease using liver ultrasound. (Very low certainty of evidence, Weak recommendation)

# CONSENSUS ISSUES

The Consensus Panel recognizes that obesity itself is a risk factor for metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD; formerly known as NAFLD). A diagnosis of MAFLD, as defined by the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver, is based on the presence of liver steatosis and at least one of the following: overweight or obesity, diabetes mellitus or metabolic dysfunction (e.g., increased waist circumference and an abnormal lipid or glycemic profile) [131].

However, the Panel gave a weak recommendation because of the following limitations:

- Screening may be difficult to implement in areas without access to a liver ultrasound.
- A screen-positive individual will require a referral to a specialist for confirmatory testing, which will necessitate additional costs.
- The linked management, GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1-RAs), are also costly, and discontinuation of the medication is associated with rebound effects such as weight gain.
- Future recommendations could be more specific to MAFLD once there are more studies that use this definition of the disease.

# KEY FINDINGS

There was no direct evidence found on the impact of routine screening for NAFLD using liver ultrasound among adults with obesity. Based on data from seven observational studies (n=1,445), the pooled sensitivity of liver ultrasound was 84.9% (95% CI 65.3, 94.4; I2=92.6%) while pooled specificity was 48.6% (95% CI 24.7, 73.1; I2=60.1%).

Treatment with GLP-1-RAs was associated with a greater probability of histological resolution of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis without worsening of liver fibrosis (RR 2.80 [95% CI 1.63, 4.81]; I2=0). Receiving GLP-1-RAs also led to increased risk of diarrhea (RR 1.90 [95% CI 1.15, 3.12]) and of decreased appetite (RR 4.24 [95% CI 1.88, 9.57]) compared to those given a placebo. Risks for mortality and for SAEs were inconclusive. The overall certainty of evidence was very low due to risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, and imprecision.

# BURDEN OF DISEASE

NAFLD is the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide [132]. The global prevalence of NAFLD is estimated to be 25%, while the prevalence in Asia is slightly higher at 27%. The prevalence varies within the Asia-Pacific region, which may be attributed to disparities in nutrition, lifestyle, and political and economic development among countries [133]. In the Philippines, the prevalence is lower at around 12%, but this figure may be underestimated due to the lack of effective screening tests to accurately ascertain NAFLD [134–136]. In contrast, a study done in Canada showed that Filipino immigrants had disproportionately higher prevalence of NAFLD compared to native counterparts [137].

Obesity has been shown to be a risk factor for NAFLD. Irrespective of race, NAFLD is especially prevalent among individuals with obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome [138]. A cross-sectional study showed that among Filipinos, a BMI >25 kg/m2 (OR 1.45), triglyceride levels >150 mg/dl (OR 1.31) and HbA1c >7% (OR 1.74) were associated with hepatic steatosis [139]. Obesity is also linked to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), to NASH-related cirrhosis, and to hepatocellular carcinoma [140]. Patients with NASH were more likely to be obese and were more likely to develop hepatocellular carcinoma than patients with NAFLD [132,138].

Despite the high prevalence, the burden of NAFLD is expected to increase as the epidemics of obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome continue to grow [141].

There is no global consensus to screen for NAFLD among patients with obesity [142–152]. Liver histology remains the gold standard for diagnosing NAFLD and staging fibrosis, but due to the invasive nature and significant cost, it is considered only for select individuals [142]. Methods to identify NAFLD remain vague [143].

# BENEFITS AND HARMS

Data from two RCTs involving patients with BMI ≥25 kg/m2 who were given GLP-1-RAs (liraglutide, semaglutide) were included in this review.

Treatment with liraglutide or semaglutide was associated with greater chances of histological resolution of NASH without worsening of liver fibrosis (RR 2.80 [95% CI 1.63, 4.81], I2=0%) [153,154] (Table 29). The most common adverse events reported were nausea (37%), diarrhea (27%), and decreased appetite (23%). Compared to those in the placebo group, more patients who took liraglutide or semaglutide experienced diarrhea (RR 1.90 [95% CI 1.15, 3.12], I2=0%) and decreased appetite (RR 4.24 [95% CI 1.88, 9.57], I2=0%) (Table 29). However, the increased incidence of nausea was not statistically significant and there was substantial heterogeneity probably due to varying GLP-1-RAs and doses (I2=81%).

The incidence of SAEs was not significantly increased in those given a GLP-1-RA. In the liraglutide group, 2 (7.7%) developed tuberculosis and migraine, both of which were deemed unrelated to treatment by the investigators [154]. In the semaglutide group, SAEs were observed in 12 (14.8%) patients who received 0.1 mg semaglutide, 15 (19.2%) patients who received 0.2 mg semaglutide, 12 (14.8%) patients who received 0.4 mg semaglutide, and 8 (10%) patients who received placebo [153]. The difference was not statistically significant and there was no dose-dependent relationship. The most common SAEs with semaglutide were gastrointestinal disorders (3.3%).

The effect of liraglutide and semaglutide on mortality among obese patients with NAFLD was inconclusive. One of the patients in the 0.2-mg semaglutide group died of sudden cardiac.
---
death [153]. The patient had type 2 diabetes mellitus and established CVD, and the event was considered unlikely related to semaglutide by the investigators. No patients died during the 60-week study period of the liraglutide trial [154].

No studies examining cirrhosis, liver failure or liver cancer outcomes among obese patients with NAFLD using GLP-1-RAs were found. This is probably due to the relatively short follow-up periods in trials as it takes a follow-up of at least 7–14 years to detect differences in these clinical outcomes [155].

# DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE

Based on data from seven observational studies on the diagnostic accuracy of liver ultrasound, the pooled sensitivity for liver ultrasound compared with liver biopsy was 84.9% (95% CI 65.3, 94.4; I2=92.6%) and the pooled specificity was 48.6% (95% CI 24.7, 73.1; I2=60.1%), with positive likelihood ratio of 1.65 and negative likelihood ratio of 0.31 [156–162] (Table 30). This means that a positive liver ultrasound for NAFLD would make the odds of a NAFLD diagnosis 1.65 times more likely while a negative liver ultrasound result would reduce the odds of NAFLD to about one-third.

The locally available dose of liraglutide is the same as that used in the trial [154]. Cost ranges from PHP 104.80–317.00 per day. The locally available dose of semaglutide (0.5–1 mg SC once weekly) was different to the dose used in the trial (daily dose of semaglutide starting at 0.05 mg SC titrated every 4 weeks until 0.4 mg/day). Semaglutide costs PHP 200 per day (computation of which was based on locally available dose of 0.5–1 mg SC once weekly).

# EQUITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND FEASIBILITY

One retrospective study (n=385) showed that screening for NAFLD with ultrasound and liver enzymes following recommendations from the European Associations for the Study of the Liver, of Diabetes, and of Obesity among individuals with severe obesity (BMI ≥35 kg/m2) led to an excessive number of specialist referrals (75.1%), which would lead to an unjustified increase in healthcare cost [163]. The increase in specialist referral, however, is likely the result of referrals due to elevated liver enzymes (45.7%), irrespective of ultrasound results. Specialist referral due to medium/high risk for fibrosis (i.e., steatosis present on ultrasound + normal liver enzymes + NAFLD fibrosis score of 2 or 3) was 29.4%.

# Strength of Recommendation/ Group (Year)

# Recommendation

# Certainty of Evidence

# ALEH (2020)

NAFLD screening is recommended for patients with repeatedly altered liver enzymes, features of metabolic syndrome, or obesity (BMI > 30).

Liver ultrasound is the most recommended technique as the first approach because of its wide availability, low-cost, and safety.

# SCD (2019)

Patients with risk factors (obesity, DM, dyslipidemia, hypertension, metabolic syndrome) should be screened for NAFLD with FLI.

Steatosis screening is aimed at patients with risk factors for NAFLD and can be performed simply with the FLI. In case of having an ultrasound with steatosis, it would be an indication to continue with the algorithm and look for fibrosis data.

# AASLD (2018)

Routine Screening for NAFLD in high-risk groups attending primary care, diabetes, or obesity clinics is not advised at this time because of uncertainties surrounding diagnostic tests and treatment options, along with lack of knowledge related to long-term benefits and cost-effectiveness of screening.

# AEEH (2018)

The at-risk population (patients with obesity, DM or MetS) should be screened for NAFLD, with study of liver enzymes and ultrasound.

The development of GLP-1-RA has to be completed (in phase iii clinical trials) before evidence-based recommendations can be made.

# Asia Pacific Working Party on NAFLD (2017)

Screening of NAFLD may be considered in at risk groups such as patients with DM and obesity.

Ultrasonography is a reasonable screening tool for NAFLD, but will not detect many cases of minor steatosis.

# EASL, EASD and EASO (2016)

Patients with IR and/or metabolic risk factors (i.e. obesity or MetS) should undergo diagnostic procedures for the diagnosis of NAFLD, which relies on the demonstration of excessive liver fat.

In subjects with obesity or MetS, screening for NAFLD by liver enzymes and/or ultrasound should be part of routine work-up.

# Chinese Society of Endocrinology (2013)

Ultrasound examination-based screening for NAFLD in high-risk adults, especially those who attend diabetes or obesity clinics, is advised.

Ultrasonography is recommended as the currently most appropriate imaging modality for NAFLD screening. The safety of anti-obesity drugs remains to be determined.

# Should we screen for obstructive sleep apnea using STOP-Bang score among adult Filipinos with obesity?

Among adult Filipinos with obesity, we suggest screening for obstructive sleep apnea using the STOP-BANG questionnaire once a year. (Very low certainty of evidence, Weak recommendation)

NOTE: consider polysomnography when STOP-BANG score ≥3

# CONSENSUS ISSUES

The Consensus Panel voted for a weak recommendation on screening for OSA using the STOP-BANG questionnaire. Although STOP-BANG would be easy to implement, training may still be needed to prepare healthcare providers to implement the tool. The frequency of screening may be adjusted depending on the presence of risk factors for OSA; the Panel acknowledges that it is possible for symptoms to resolve between STOP-BANG assessments.

# KEY FINDINGS

There is no direct evidence on screening for OSA using STOP-BANG among adults with obesity. Pooled results of diagnostic accuracy studies (n=28,644) show that STOP-BANG is highly sensitive (91.3% [95% CI 88.6, 93.4]; I2=95.4%) but had low specificity (36.0% [95% CI 28.3, 44.5]; I2=91.7%). There was high variability between the pooled studies, which is likely due to differences in the comparator used and in the characteristics of the study population.

Treatment of OSA with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) showed improved quality of life among individuals with obesity and diabetes mellitus (adjusted MD -4.6 [95% CI -9.0, -0.1]) and higher BMI (WMD 0.148 kg/m2 [95% CI 0.04, 0.26]), but unclear benefits for other outcomes. The overall certainty of evidence is very low because of indirect evidence on linked treatment with OSA, imprecision and significant heterogeneity.

# BURDEN OF DISEASE

OSA is an important condition that is commonly associated with obesity. It refers to a recurrent form of upper airway obstruction resulting in sleep disturbance, agitation, and episodic oxygen desaturation especially during sleep [164]. Obesity is considered to be the most common predisposing factor for OSA, with about a tenfold increase in acquiring OSA among individuals with a BMI of >30 kg/m2 [165]. The burden of OSA, especially among persons with obesity, is palpable. In a cross-sectional study featuring Asian patients with obesity who are candidates for bariatric surgery, the prevalence of OSA was as high as 80.5% [166].

There are several tools available to screen for OSA, and the most commonly used are the Epworth Sleepiness scale, the Berlin questionnaire, and the STOP-BANG questionnaire. The STOP-BANG questionnaire (Appendix 4) is a validated screening tool for OSA that screens for snoring, tiredness, observed apnea, blood pressure or the presence of hypertension, BMI >35 kg/m2, age >50 years, neck circumference >40 cm, gender (male). A score of 3 is generally employed to detect all forms of OSA [167]. A study conducted by Arslan and colleagues in 2020 found that STOP-BANG demonstrated the highest sensitivity for detecting high-risk patients for OSA [168].

# BENEFITS AND HARMS

One open-label RCT explored the effect of CPAP compared with conventional treatment among persons with obesity and diabetes mellitus on health-related quality of life [169]. This RCT demonstrated that after 6 months, patients treated with CPAP had a significantly better satisfaction with the treatment domain of the Diabetes Quality of Life questionnaire compared to patients on the conventional treatment arm, with an intergroup adjusted difference of -4.6 (95% CI -9.0, -0.1) (Table 33). Evidence on linked management also showed that combined management of CPAP with weight loss led to a significant reduction in blood pressure (WMD -8.89 mm Hg [95% CI -13.67, -4.1]) compared to CPAP alone [170]. When CPAP coupled with weight loss intervention was compared to weight loss intervention alone for adult patients with OSA and obesity, results showed a decrease in systolic blood pressure, favoring the combined therapy (WMD -3.88 mmHg [95% CI -7.78, 0.02]).

However, the benefit of CPAP on diabetes, weight loss, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease is inconclusive. A meta-analysis done by the reviewers of seven RCTs involving a total of 265 patients treated with CPAP and 300 patients treated with usual care revealed that CPAP therapy did not significantly reduce HbA1c levels in patients with diabetes mellitus [169,171–176]. In a meta-analysis of 39 RCTs (n=6,954), it was found that BMI increased after initiation of CPAP therapy (WMD 0.148 kg/m2 [95% CI 0.04, 0.26]; p=0.001), but subgroup analysis revealed that patients who exhibited an increase in BMI were those without CVD at baseline, those with dysglycemia, and those who used CPAP for only ≤5 hours a night [177]. Among those with CVD, CPAP decreased BMI (WMD -0.188 [95% CI -0.299, -0.078]). Pooled data from eight RCTs (n=5,817) also failed to provide evidence that CPAP could reduce the number of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) or stroke events [178]. The relatively short follow-up period in the included studies may have contributed to the lack of significant event seen.

There were no adverse outcomes associated with screening for OSA using the STOP-BANG questionnaire reported across all the studies reviewed. The certainty of evidence was downgraded due to indirectness, heterogeneity (different populations and comparators, varying adherence) and wide confidence intervals of the effect estimates.

# DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE

Data from a systematic review of cohort studies from different regions worldwide that investigated the diagnostic accuracy of STOP-BANG, as well as from six additional cohort studies, were included in this review. Pooled results show that STOP-BANG as a screening tool has a sensitivity of 91.3% (95% CI 88.6%, 93.4%) and specificity of 36.0% (95% CI 28.3%, 44.5%) [167,179–184] (Table 34). Heterogeneity was significant for both sensitivity (p<0.0001, I2=95.4%) and specificity (p<0.0001, I2= 91.7%). Differences in the comparator used for the STOP-BANG questionnaire could be a source of variation. For instance, some studies utilized polysomnography (apnea-hypopnea index), while other studies used home sleep apnea testing as the comparator or the diagnostic reference standard. The differences in the characteristics of the study populations (ex. presence of co-morbidities) are another driver of the significant heterogeneity observed.

The certainty of evidence for the pooled sensitivity is moderate while the certainty of evidence for the pooled specificity is low. Downgrading was done due to inconsistent results and wide confidence intervals among some of the studies included, as well as marked heterogeneity.

# COST IMPLICATION

Studies are needed to determine the cost-effectiveness of the STOP-BANG questionnaire for screening in the local setting, but minimal cost is expected for this screening strategy. Treatment for OSA in the form of CPAP ranges from PHP 50,000.00–100,000.00*.

# Should we screen for depression among adult Filipinos with obesity?

Among adult Filipinos with obesity, we recommend screening for depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 tool every 6 months. (Very low certainty of evidence, Strong recommendation)

NOTE: consider referral to a psychiatrist when PHQ-9 score ≥10

# CONSENSUS ISSUES

Despite the very low certainty of evidence, the panelists voted for a strong recommendation due to the following considerations:

- The prevalence of depression has increased in recent years.
- The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is a simple, accurate, and accessible questionnaire that can be self-administered.
- Screening for depression is further supported by the Mental Health Act (RA 11036).
- Aside from antidepressants, psychological interventions such as psychotherapy and lifestyle modification may be implemented among individuals with symptoms of depression.

The panelists also acknowledge the challenges of implementing a nationwide screening program.

- There may not be enough psychiatrists in the Philippines to manage a continued uptick of cases with depression. However, primary care providers may assist in the initial management of depression.
- Training is needed for primary care providers to ensure that the PHQ-9 will be administered in a sensitive and empathetic manner.
- A Filipino version of the PHQ-9 is available but has only been validated among migrant Filipinos.

# KEY FINDINGS

No direct evidence was found on the impact of screening for depression among Filipinos with obesity. Indirect evidence came from one diagnostic cross-sectional study on the PHQ-9 and one RCT on a comprehensive behavioral intervention among adults with obesity. PHQ-9 had a sensitivity of 87.8% (95% CI 74.5, 94.7) and a specificity of 87.9% (95% CI 84.9, 90.4) when compared to a diagnosis of major depression by a mental health professional.

A 12-month intervention including problem-solving strategies and as-needed antidepressants resulted in more participants with weight loss ≥5% from baseline (RR 1.85 [95% CI 1.21, 2.83]) and improved obesity-specific quality of life (MD -4.7 [95% CI -9.8, 0.3]). Lower BMI was also associated with improved obesity-specific quality of life, after adjusting for age, sex, treatment group assignment, and baseline value (β 0.01 [95% CI 0.01, 0.02]). There was no significant difference in adverse events in the intervention and control groups.

# BURDEN OF DISEASE

Obesity and depression are frequently co-occurring and highly prevalent conditions, with 40% of U.S. adults classified as obese and 21% who suffer from depression at least once in their lifetime [186]. In the Philippines, it is estimated that about 27 million Filipinos (~36.6%) are obese [4].

The causal relationship between obesity and depression is complex. A recent meta-analysis found that obesity increased the risk for depression and that depression increased the odds of developing obesity. Literature also suggests that obesity is a risk factor for depression and that these comorbidities are risk factors for a bad prognosis illness [187]. Body image dissatisfaction, as well as weight and shape concerns, were found to contribute to depression among obese patients [188]. In addition, mental health disorders and inflammation could also be potentially involved in ‘visceral adipose tissue’ (fatty tissues around major abdominal organs), which could lead to altered hormonal levels among other detrimental health effects [189].

Depression has also been shown to interfere with weight loss. Patients with obesity and untreated depression lost less weight during weight loss treatment, while patients who recovered from depression had weight loss success equal to that of those who were not depressed [190]. In addition, obesity and depression carry an increased risk of CVD [191]. Individuals with both obesity and depression report poorer health-related quality of life than those with only either or neither condition [192].

The PHQ-9 (Appendix 4) is a three-page questionnaire that scores each of the nine DSM-IV criteria for depression from “0” (not at all) to “3” (nearly every day). It could be used for screening, diagnosis, and monitoring of the condition. Major depression rarely occurs among PHQ-9 scores <10 and is frequently seen with scores of ≥15 [193]. The recent Philippine Guidelines on Periodic Health Examination (PHEX) recommended screening apparently healthy adults for depression using the PHQ-9 twice a year [194]. A Filipino version of the PHQ-9 was translated by the Mapi Research Institute from Pfizer, Inc. and was recently validated in a study on Filipino migrant domestic workers in Macao.

# BENEFITS AND HARMS

Two RCTs were included in this review. In one study, the effect of an integrated collaborative care intervention for adults with both obesity and depression was investigated in comparison with usual medical care. Data on obesity-specific quality of life was included from the other study.

After 12 months, almost twice as many participants in the I-CARE group achieved weight loss of ≥ 5% from baseline compared to the usual care group (RR 1.85 [95% CI 1.21, 2.83]) [195] (Table 36). Participants who received the problem-solving and weight loss intervention had lower scores on the Obesity-Related Problems Scale at the 12-month follow-up (mean 54.3 [SD 25.9] vs. 56.1 [SD 27.2]) [196]. The intervention group scored 4.7 points lower, on average, compared to the usual care group (MD -4.7 [95% CI -9.8, 0.3]). Lower BMI was also associated with improvement in the obesity related problems scale after adjusting for age, sex, treatment group assignment and baseline value (β 0.01 [95% CI 0.01, 0.02]). There was no significant difference in the incidence of SAEs between the I-CARE and usual care group (RR 0.96 [95% CI 0.48, 1.88]) [195]. Thirteen participants required hospitalization and 10 involved musculoskeletal injuries needing outpatient procedures. No mortalities occurred during follow-up.

# DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE

An RCT among respondents who did not have obesity was included for this outcome. The respondents were asked to complete the PHQ-9 questionnaire and undergo a validation interview with a mental health professional, which were compared with the reference standard (diagnosis of major depression by a mental health professional). Using a cut-off score of 10, the PHQ-9 tool had high sensitivity (87.8% [95% CI 74.5, 94.7]) and specificity (87.9% [95% CI 84.9, 90.4]) for major depression compared to an interview with a mental health professional [193] (Table 37). A score of PHQ-9 <10 reduces the odds of depression by 86%, while a score of ≥10 increases the odds of depression sevenfold.

# COST IMPLICATION

There were no local cost-effectiveness studies on the use of PHQ-9 among Filipino patients with overweight or obesity, but distribution of the screening tool is expected to incur minimal costs.

An international study aimed to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of screening followed by collaborative care, reporting that over the average lifespan of a 20-year-old residing in New York City, the incremental cost-effectiveness of these interventions was about USD 1,726.00 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained (95% plausible interval: cost-saving, USD 10,594/QALY gained) [197].

# EQUITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND FEASIBILITY

The recent PHEX Guideline on Screening of Asymptomatic Individuals recommended screening for depression among asymptomatic, apparently healthy individuals using PHQ-9 [194]. The guideline concluded that the tool was equitable, acceptable, and feasible, but that accessibility to depression management should be improved.

# Should we screen for osteoarthritis among adult Filipinos with obesity?

Among adult Filipinos with obesity, we recommend screening for osteoarthritis using the American College of Radiology clinical classification criteria at every visit. (Very low certainty of evidence, Strong recommendation)

# CONSENSUS ISSUES

Despite the very low certainty of evidence, the Consensus Panel agreed upon a strong recommendation for screening of osteoarthritis using the American College of Radiology (ACR) clinical classification criteria due to the following considerations:

- Weight and obesity are often considered in the assessment of patients for osteoarthritis.
- Screening with the ACR criteria is easy to implement and can be provided at little to no cost.
- There are significant, positive long-term impacts with early detection and intervention for osteoarthritis including increased productivity and decreased work absences.
- Screening may also raise awareness among patients regarding the role of weight gain and obesity in causing osteoarthritis.

# KEY FINDINGS

There was no direct evidence on screening for knee osteoarthritis among persons with obesity. Evidence from a cross-sectional study on the diagnostic accuracy of the ACR criteria showed that the criteria had moderate specificity (76.8% [95% CI 70.1, 82.4]) but lower sensitivity (39.1% [95% CI 31.2, 47.6]) against a combination of symptoms and knee radiograph when used to detect knee osteoarthritis among adults with BMI ≥30 kg/m2.

In a meta-analysis of five RCTs on weight loss interventions among patients with overweight or obesity, interventions that resulted in weight loss >5% led to a significant reduction in pain (SMD 0.33 [95% CI 0.17, 0.48]), self-reported disability (SMD 0.42 [95% CI 0.25, 0.59]), and physical quality of life (SMD 0.39 [95% CI 0.24, 0.54]). The overall certainty of evidence is low due to indirect evidence, issues on allocation concealment and blinding, as well as imprecision.

# BURDEN OF DISEASE

Osteoarthritis is a heterogenous group of conditions that results in the loss of integrity of the articular cartilages of the joints. It is a leading cause of pain, disability, and loss of productivity. As of 1997, about 4% of adults in an urban community in Metro Manila had osteoarthritis based on the ACR criteria [198]. There is no gold standard in the diagnosis of osteoarthritis, but clinicians may base their diagnosis on the presence of symptoms and pathology. An X-ray and the Kellgren Lawrence grading system are often used for the radiographic diagnosis of osteoarthritis, while clinical classification criteria may be used to diagnose osteoarthritis in the absence of imaging [199,200]. The most commonly used clinical classification criteria for knee osteoarthritis are the ACR criteria (Table 39).

| |ESR &lt; 40mm/hour|
| |RF &lt; 1:40|
| |SF signs of osteoarthritis|

aThe ACR criteria may be applied through different assessment methods, but the current CPG focuses on using the criteria through history and physical examination.

# BENEFITS AND HARMS

A meta-analysis of RCTs that investigated the effect of weight loss interventions compared to usual care on the outcomes pain improvement, self-reported disability, and quality of life among adults with obesity (mean BMI range: 33.6–36.4 kg/m2) was included [202]. Interventions resulting in &gt;5% weight loss led to a greater decrease in pain score (SMD 0.33 [95% CI 0.17, 0.48]; I2=0%) on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index scale among patients with obesity and knee osteoarthritis (Table 40). Similarly, weight loss interventions resulted in greater improvement in self-reported disability (SMD 0.42 [95% CI 0.25, 0.59]; I2=0%) and physical quality of life (SMD 0.39 [95% CI 0.24, 0.54]). Meanwhile, there was no significant effect on the mental component of quality of life. The certainty of evidence for efficacy outcomes was downgraded due to indirectness and issues on allocation concealment and blinding given subjectively reported outcomes.

# DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE

Based on data from a cross-sectional study, the ACR clinical classification criteria had moderate specificity (76.8% [95% CI 70.1, 82.4]) but lower sensitivity (39.1% [95% CI 31.2, 47.6]) when compared with a combination of symptoms and knee radiograph among adults with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 [203] (Table 41). Meeting the ACR criteria increased the odds of having osteoarthritis by 69%, while a negative result lowered the odds by 21%. The certainty of evidence was downgraded to moderate because of an imprecise estimate for specificity.

# Should we screen for medications associated with weight gain among adult Filipinos with obesity?

Among adult Filipinos with obesity, we recommend screening for the use of obesogenic medications for other health conditions at every visit. (Low certainty of evidence, Strong recommendation)

# CONSENSUS ISSUES

Despite the low certainty of evidence, the Consensus Panel voted for a strong recommendation for screening for obesogenic medications because of the following considerations:

- Screening would incur minimal to no undesirable effects, low to no costs, would be acceptable and feasible, and would promote equity among adult Filipinos with obesity.
- Screening would provide an opportunity for healthcare practitioners to promote other interventions for weight loss, and would help inform management decisions, particularly among those who want to achieve weight loss.

# KEY FINDINGS

No direct evidence on the effect of screening for weight gain-associated medications was found. Instead, two RCTs provided indirect evidence on linked management for weight loss among patients with obesity being treated with obesogenic medications for an underlying disease. Patients treated with a non-pharmacologic intervention (i.e., lifestyle modification) for diabetes mellitus had increased odds of achieving total weight loss ≥5% (OR 14.92 [95% CI 12.61, 17.23]) after adjusting for race/ethnicity, baseline BMI, presence of hypertension, Beck depression inventory score and obesogenic medication. Likewise, patients treated with a pharmacologic intervention for hypertension (i.e., metformin) experienced greater weight loss (MD -1.10 kg [95% CI -2.10, -0.10]) and greater decreases in BMI (MD -0.48 kg/m2 [95% CI -0.89, -0.07]). The overall certainty of evidence is low because of high risk of bias due to non-blinding and indirectness.

# BURDEN OF DISEASE

Obesogenic medications are pharmacologic therapies associated with an increased risk of unintentional weight gain. Intake of obesogenic medications can affect weight gain through decreased metabolic rate, adverse metabolic effects on lipids and/or insulin sensitivity, increased appetite, or increased fluid retention [205]. These potential adverse effects can result in poor medication adherence and the subsequent worsening of health outcomes. However, the early identification of the use of medications that cause weight gain may lead to the use of more weight-neutral alternatives to avoid unwanted weight-related complications [11,206].

# BENEFITS AND HARMS

Two RCTs among patients with BMI ≥25 kg/m2 being treated with obesogenic medications for an underlying disease were included. In one RCT, patients with diabetes mellitus were treated with at least one obesogenic anti-diabetic medication along with either a non-pharmacologic intervention (i.e., lifestyle modification) or standard of care for diabetes (n=3,199) [207]. The trial investigated the effect of non-pharmacologic intervention on total weight loss ≥5% (adjusting for race/ethnicity, baseline BMI, presence of hypertension, Beck depression inventory score and obesogenic medication). The other RCT included adults diagnosed with hypertension being treated with an obesogenic anti-hypertensive medication (i.e., metformin; n=94) [208]. The study aimed to examine the effect of a pharmacologic intervention in changing actual body weight and BMI after 1 year of treatment.

Findings on an RCT that compared non-pharmacological intervention and standard of care among patients being treated with an obesogenic drug for diabetes showed that the odds of having total weight loss ≥5% among those who underwent lifestyle modification was 15 times higher than that of the comparison group (adjusted OR 14.92 [95% CI 12.61, 17.23]) (Table 44) [207] (Table 44). In another study, treatment with metformin was associated with

significantly higher weight loss (MD -1.10 kg [95% CI -2.10, -0.10]) and a significantly larger decrease in BMI than those without intervention (MD -0.48 kg/m2 [95% CI -0.89, -0.07]).

The overall certainty of evidence for the efficacy outcomes is low due to risk of bias from non-blinding, and indirectness.

# DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE

Screening through taking a patient’s clinical history is considered an acceptable reference standard in determining the intake of obesogenic medications.

# COST IMPLICATION

There is no cost for doctors and patients to screen for the use of obesogenic medications by history-taking.

# EQUITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND FEASIBILITY

There were no studies found discussing patient’s values and preferences, including stigma, social impact, or other perspectives regarding screening for use of obesogenic medications.

# RECOMMENDATIONS FROM OTHER GROUPS

# Applicability Issues

# Organizational considerations to implementation

The capacity for laboratory testing (i.e., TSH, OGTT) and imaging (i.e., ultrasound) may vary at the regional, provincial, and municipal level, which may present challenges for nationwide implementation of the CPG. However, the remaining screening tools could be readily provided at minimal to no cost since screening would involve either the use of questionnaires, history-taking, physical exams, or low-cost tools such as a tape measure. Healthcare providers must be trained to ensure that an assessment would be performed correctly to yield accurate results. Some materials such as a sphygmomanometer are already available in most facilities, but an investment in larger-sized cuffs may be needed to accommodate adults with obesity.

The availability of treatment for the conditions covered in this CPG may also present as a limitation. Certain medications may vary in availability at different levels of the health system. For some interventions (e.g., bariatric surgery, behavioral therapy, or intensive lifestyle modification), there may not be enough specialists to facilitate management if screening would result in a significant increase in cases. However, although the CPG explored the effectiveness of various treatment options from medication to surgical interventions, the first-line treatment for all conditions covered would be in the form of lifestyle interventions that may be advised even at the level of primary care.

# Resource implications

The cost of screening tests and linked interventions were important considerations during the Consensus Panel meetings, although data was limited on the cost-effectiveness of these interventions at the local setting. Health technology assessment is vital to ensuring that the investments the government will make to implement this CPG will be cost-effective.

# Monitoring and Evaluation

# Dissemination

The final CPG manuscript will be submitted to the National Practice Guideline Clearinghouse of the DOH for review and approval prior to dissemination. Electronic copies of the evidence base and the final manuscript will be available through the DOH, VSMMC and the organizations involved in the CPG development. These institutions are also responsible for promoting the use and uptake of these recommendations across the Philippines to other possible stakeholders through publications, lectures, and other forms of notifications.

# Dissemination to Industry Partners, Regulatory Agencies, and Payors

The Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of DOH will distribute copies of this CPG to the PHIC, health maintenance organizations, and pharmaceutical industry partners. The DOH will release a memorandum to notify all stakeholders of the publication.

# Dissemination to Medical Societies and Training Institutions

This CPG will be presented during conferences and annual conventions of medical societies and other public health forums. Electronic copies of this CPG with the endorsement of relevant medical institutions will be sent to medical schools and libraries to integrate the recommendations in their training curricula, with the support of the faculty members and heads of hospital-based departments, including but not limited to surgery, radiology, pathology, and internal medicine.

# Dissemination to Patients and Public in General

A simplified version of this CPG will be developed by the Obesity CPG Task Force, headed by the Steering Committee, for reproduction and dissemination to patients in clinics and hospitals.

# Implementation

Based on the results of the guideline development process, significant changes to policy related to the diagnosis and management of obesity and its related conditions may be needed. One such change is the lowering of cutoffs for the diagnosis of obesity, which is due to the higher risk of diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension among Filipinos at smaller values. Adopting these recommended cutoff values would facilitate the screening and early identification of Filipinos who have higher risks of CVD and related conditions, as well as enable healthcare providers to institute the appropriate early preventive and therapeutic interventions for Filipino adults. The guideline recommendations would also make workup of comorbid conditions more directed and cost-effective. This will hopefully lead to decreased government spending on treatment and rehabilitation of people with obesity-related complications.

The Obesity CPG Task Force will distribute a questionnaire annually to determine the best practices of relevant stakeholders in the screening, diagnosis, and management of the risk factors and conditions of individuals with overweight or obesity. Monitoring the use of this CPG may also be a subject of research by interested parties. For monitoring and auditing, the Task Force will use the final strength of recommendation to determine key performance indicators. Recommendations qualified as “strong” will be used as indicators.
---
# Updating of the guidelines

The recommendations of this CPG shall hold until such time that new evidence on screening strategies or diagnostic tests for overweight and obesity emerges or other contingencies compel the updating of this CPG. The Obesity CPG Task Force intends to review this CPG no later than 2026. There is currently a separate plan to develop a CPG dedicated to the treatment and follow-up of obesity among Filipino adults.
---
# Research Implications/Gaps

This guideline was based on primarily low- to very low-certainty evidence. For most of the screening questions, there was limited direct evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for the included obesity-related risk factors and conditions. Hence, there is a need for more high-quality studies assessing the effectiveness, safety, and diagnostic accuracy of screening on local populations with obesity.

Although data on costs for the screening strategy and related interventions were available, these studies on cost-effectiveness were from other countries and evidence was found for select review questions: PCOS, dysglycemia, dyslipidemia, and depression. There were no local cost-effectiveness studies found for any of the screening interventions covered in this guideline.

Future research is also needed to substantiate evidence on patient values and preferences, and on the equity, feasibility, and acceptability of screening among individuals with overweight or obesity for the risk factors and conditions included in this guideline. Only half of the screening questions had evidence for any of these considerations, and most of these studies were done among non-Filipino participants.

# Measurement of WC and WHR

1. Subject stands with feet 25–30 cm apart, weight evenly distributed.
2. Measurer sits by the side of the subject and fits the tape snugly but not compressing soft tissues.
1. Waist circumference: measurement is taken midway between the inferior margin of the last rib and the crest of the ilium in a horizontal plane.
2. Hip circumference: measurement is taken around the pelvis at the point of maximal protrusion of the buttocks.
3. Circumference is measured to nearest 0.1 cm.
4. Wait-to-hip ratio: Divide the waist circumference by the hip circumference.

Procedure from World Health Organization Western Pacific Region. The Asia-Pacific perspective: Redefining obesity and its treatment. 2000. Link

# Measurement of Blood Pressure

- The patient should be relaxed and rested >5min, in a sitting position, feet flat on the floor, back supported.
- No coffee, smoking, or exercise in the last 30 minutes.
- Urinary bladder should be emptied.
- No talking for both the patient and observer.
- The patient’s arm should be resting on a desk.
- Check BP on both arms and use the arm with the higher BP on subsequent BP determination.
- The cuff should be of correct size, placed snug over the upper arm that is preferably without sleeves, with its middle portion at the level of the heart. It should cover 40% of the upper arm and 80% of the arm circumference (standard bladder for adults is 13 cm wide, 22-24 cm long).
- When using a manual device, cuff deflation should be done at 2 mmHg/sec.
- Ideally, the systolic pressure should be estimated initially by the pulse obliteration upon inflation. Actual auscultatory determination is then done by inflating the cuff 20-30 mmHg above this palpated estimate.
- For auscultatory determination, use the fifth Korotkoff sound to determine the diastolic BP.
- Use an average ≥ 2 readings obtained on ≥ 2 occasions as an estimate of the BP level.
- The interval between BP measurements should be 1-2 min apart.
