      "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the country today. Several factors contribute to cardiovascular disease, with environmental influences and lifestyle changes being the primary culprits. Cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, elevated cholesterol, obesity, and physical inactivity are some identified factors that can lead to cardiovascular death. Early identification and addressing of these factors may reduce the burden of cardiovascular diseases in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, it is important to recognize the significance of screening individuals for cardiovascular diseases. This consensus statement addresses screening for cardiovascular diseases among apparently healthy, asymptomatic adult Filipino individuals. Such individuals are generally considered to have no overt symptoms of cardiovascular disease, such as chest pain, difficulty breathing, or claudication, among others. The consensus panel also defined these individuals as lacking modifiable risk factors such as cigarette smoking, hypertension, and diabetes. The critical cardiovascular outcomes include cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular disease.\n",

      "3. GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGY\n",
      "\n",
      "3.1 Organization of the Process\n",
      "\n",
      "Following international standards, the Department of Health (DOH) outlined the guideline development process into four phases: 1) preparation and prioritization, 2) Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) generation, 3) CPG appraisal, and 4) implementation in the Manual for CPG Development [1].\n",
      "\n",
      "In the preparation and prioritization phase, the Steering Committee set the CPG objectives, scope, target audience, and clinical questions. They consulted different stakeholders in prioritizing and developing the guideline questions. They identified and formed the working groups involved in creating the evidence base and finalizing the recommendations for each clinical question included.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evidence review experts (ERE) or the technical working group were tasked to review existing CPGs, appraise and summarize the evidence, and draft the initial recommendations. The evidence summaries were then presented to the consensus panel members to finalize the recommendations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The consensus panel comprised multisectoral representatives tasked to review the evidence summaries and develop recommendations during the en banc meeting. In the meeting, they prioritized critical and important outcomes, discussed necessary considerations revolving around the recommendations, and voted on each.\n",
      "The following text describes the process of developing evidence summaries for the Philippine Guidelines on Periodic Health Examination (PHEX) 2021, specifically focusing on cardiovascular disease screening. A modified Delphi method was used to resolve recommendations not settled during the en banc meeting. Clinical questions were formulated using the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) format. The Evidence Review Experts (ERE) searched and appraised international practice guidelines, including those from the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Guidelines of good quality and published within the last five years (2016-2021) were adopted. Initial cardiovascular risk factors and diseases identified for PHEX included hypertension, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation, carotid artery stenosis, coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, and abdominal aortic aneurysm. The second phase of PHEX focused on familial hypercholesterolemia, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, carotid artery stenosis, peripheral artery disease, and abdominal aortic aneurysm. Systematic searches in electronic databases like MEDLINE via PubMed, CENTRAL, and Google Scholar were conducted from May to November 2021. Evidence summaries were generated for sixteen questions, assessing the burden of the problem, diagnostic performance, benefits, harm, and social and economic impact of the screening tests or interventions. The quality of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE approach.\n",
      "The important step in the creation of this clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) is determining the strengths of the recommendation. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used in assessing the recommendations. The Steering Committee (SC) and the Evidence Review Experts (ERE) identified the outcomes that were used in deciding the recommendations for the clinical questions (refer to Table 1). \n",

      "\n",
      "Evidence-to-Decision Considerations:\n",
      "Most domains favor the intervention. While physical activity is generally valued, the life priorities of patients vary. Some communities still do not view weight loss or weight management as desirable and instead think of obesity as being \"healthy.\" Some panelists raised concerns about interventions being time-intensive for both patients and providers. Training may incur expenses for healthcare workers, such as for travel to sessions. Patients will also need to consider access to and costs of decent internet connection and text messaging for communication with their healthcare professionals. For adolescents, conclusive benefits are limited to the reduction in blood pressure, but the evidence may change eventually. Patients at the extremes of growth charts will require more intensive interventions, and these can be costly and time-consuming. The potential advantages of weight management, including the reduction in noncommunicable diseases and economic impacts, outweigh its challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.4.1 Burden of Disease\n",
      "In the Philippines, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as hypertensive heart disease, ischemic heart disease, and diabetes were among the leading causes of death in 2019. In 2020, approximately 67% of deaths were attributable to NCDs. Ischemic heart disease and diabetes were also among the top causes of disability-adjusted life years, ranking 1st and 6th, respectively. The rise in NCDs is driven by modifiable risk factors. Of these, tobacco use, high blood pressure, high fasting plasma glucose, and high body mass index are among the top causes of deaths and disability. The prevalence of overweight and obesity among adults has increased from 16.6% in 1993 to 37.2% in 2018, while that of high fasting blood glucose doubled from 3.4% in 2003 to 6.7% in 2018. In those aged 20 years and above, the prevalence of elevated blood pressure remains high at 19% in 2018. Furthermore, around 4 in 10 adults (40.6%) report being insufficiently physically active.\n",
      "\n",
      "NCDs also significantly affect the adolescent population, although this remains largely overlooked. Studies have shown that NCDs are primarily attributed to risk factors that emerge during the adolescent years; approximately 70% of premature deaths occurring in adulthood are the result of health-related behaviors in childhood and adolescence. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity in children and adolescents has increased in the last two decades. Around 14.4 million children and adolescents in the United States were obese, with an overall prevalence of 19.3% in 2017-2018, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Due to this increasing global burden on the younger population, there has been a corresponding rise in interest and efforts in adolescent health and wellbeing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent recommendations have emphasized the inclusion of behavioral interventions promoting a healthy lifestyle, in addition to traditional pharmacologic treatment. Local and global societies have highlighted the importance of a multifaceted, multidisciplinary, and patient-centered approach for both prevention and management of NCDs.

      "15. WHO suggests a potassium intake of at least 90 mmol/day (3510 mg/day) for adults. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence)\n",
      "\n",
      "Evidence-to-Decision Considerations:\n",
      "\n",
      "The panel considered three guidelines that met preset criteria for adaptation: WHO Healthy Diet Fact Sheet 2018 (based on various WHO Nutrition Guidelines), Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020-2025, and the Nutrition Guidelines for Filipinos 2012. All three guidelines are similar in that they all take a life-course approach and recommend healthy diets that include a variety of nutrient-rich food, more vegetables and fruits, and limited amounts of added sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats. The full text manuscript of the Philippine Nutritional Guidelines could not be located and retrieved; the available article did not include a link to the evidence base. However, it seems like the Nutritional Guidelines for Filipinos, which is the basis for the \"Pinggang Pinoy,\" is also at least partly based on the WHO guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eight out of 8 panelists (100%) voted to adapt the 2018 WHO Healthy Diet Fact Sheet, which is based on the 2003 WHO technical report on Diet, Nutrition and the Prevention of Chronic Diseases, the 2012 WHO guidelines on Sodium and Potassium intake, the 2015 WHO guidelines on sugars intake, and the 2018 WHO guidelines on saturated fatty acid and trans-fatty acids. The panel decided to adapt the WHO guidelines because of potential applicability issues with the American guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS\n",
      "Development of this guideline engaged several stakeholders, including primary care providers and patient representatives. While priority questions were tackled by the guideline, other topics such as alcohol use and testing for sexually transmitted infections were not included. More formal health needs assessments may also be beneficial in planning clinical guidelines and policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most evidence for effectiveness and safety outcomes was of low certainty. Direct evidence on the prevention of internet addiction and internet gaming disorder, which are evolving concepts, is still lacking. Longer follow-ups may be necessary to get a better picture of the benefits and harms of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). There remains room for robust trials on lifestyle advice and interventions, as well as observational studies leveraging causal inference methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cost-effectiveness studies from the Philippines and similar settings are still needed. Research into other evidence-to-decision dimensions, such as patient values surveys and health equity impact assessments, is also necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. DISSEMINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION\n",
      "\n",
      "A full copy of this document will be sent to the Department of Health for transmittal and publication. The Disease Prevention and Control Bureau will transmit copies of this Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) to the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PHIC) and health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and NGOs involved in periodic health examinations.\n",
      "\n",
      "All strong recommendations in this guideline can be used for monitoring and auditing practices in institutions. These can be converted to key performance indicators and can also be used in creating clinical pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Department of Health plans to develop a simplified version of this CPG and make it available in a format ready for reproduction and dissemination to patients in different healthcare settings. It will also be available for interested parties who might visit the Department of Health website.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. APPLICABILITY ISSUES\n",
      "This Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) does not necessarily override the values of its users, which include health professionals, hospital administrators, employers, payors, and patients, as well as the settings and circumstances in which they operate. While the PHEX (Periodic Health Examination) Lifestyle Task Force aims these recommendations at the Filipino population, it acknowledges the variability in individual risks, preferences, and access to resources, among other factors. Users and policymakers should consider the applicability and equity issues according to unique circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although this CPG aims to influence the direction of health policies for the general population, it should not be the sole basis for creating or abolishing practices intended to improve the health conditions of many Filipinos, particularly those in the workforce.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. UPDATING OF THE GUIDELINES  \n",
      "The recommendations herein shall remain valid until new evidence on screening, diagnosing, or managing various risk factors and diseases emerges, necessitating an update of these Philippine Guidelines on Periodic Health Examination. The CPGs will be updated every 3-5 years or earlier if new significant evidence becomes available.\n",

(Strong recommendation, very low certainty of evidence)\n",
      "\n",
      "Evidence-to-Decision Considerations\n",
      "The evidence did not show significant adverse effects with counseling on safe sex. While rural health units already stock condoms, there remains a high resource requirement in terms of training and distributing personnel. Patient burden is likely low, and several panelists view the non-pharmacologic interventions as cost-effective and beneficial. Preferences and acceptability may differ from other geographical regions, and Filipino sexual attitudes are shaped by the predominant religion. Health promotion and disease prevention (i.e., sexually transmitted infections) are aligned with universal healthcare goals. The burden of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and teenage pregnancy is also of concern, and so early intervention for high-risk individuals is desirable. Adolescents still require the consent of their parents and are economically dependent on the latter. The existence of adolescent-friendly health facilities may aid with implementation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.3.1 Burden of Disease\n",
      "The last Young Adult Fertility and Sexuality Study in the Philippines (YAFS4), conducted in 2013, observed an increasing proportion of youth who have begun sexual activity before the age of 18, with an almost two-fold increase to 23% in 2013 from 13% in 1994. [1] In 2008, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported that one in three births was unplanned, either unwanted or mistimed. [PSA] In the Philippines, it is estimated that there are almost 2 million unintended pregnancies per year and over 600,000 unsafe abortions. It was also stated that only 3% of women who desired to avoid pregnancy received contraceptive counseling. [High Rates of Unintended Pregnancies 2019] The YAFS4 survey also revealed that the proportion of 15- to 19-year-old individuals who have already gotten pregnant increased two-fold from 6.3% in 2002 to 13.6% in 2013. [1] Risky sexual behaviors lead to complications such as unintended pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections, and mental health issues. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), unwanted pregnancies may lead to serious health risks to the mother, which may include malnutrition, abuse, unsafe abortion, and even death. [High Rates of Unintended Pregnancies 2019] Untreated sexually transmitted infections may lead to other conditions that ultimately cause a considerable burden to patients. [Chesson 2017] In 2016, the Philippines became the fastest-growing epidemic in HIV in the Asia-Pacific region, with the majority of new cases occurring among 15- to 24-year-old males who have sex with males and transgender women who have sex with males. [Philippines Addresses Rising Trend in New HIV Infections 2021] Filipinos are prevented from getting adequate access to sexual and reproductive health care due to socio-cultural and political factors. [2] These structural inequalities lead to varying health interventions received by patients. Management would depend on whether complications from risky sexual behaviors took place. Economic impact of the disease.\n",
      "************************************************************\n",
      "In 2016, the United Nations Population Fund Philippines (UNFPA) reported a loss of Php 33 billion in potential life income due to early pregnancy, which affects the completion of education and results in a significant decrease in predicted daily wages. [UNFPA Philippines 2021] The University of the Philippines School of Economics released an article in 2011 stating that 22% of married women among the poorest families fail to use any birth control methods despite wanting to avoid pregnancies. In the same paper, it was stated that family size is closely associated with poverty incidence, creating difficult financial situations for families with mistimed and unplanned pregnancies.

Primary care physicians play a large role in sexual and reproductive health, especially in providing interventions such as counseling, sex education, and other behavioral approaches to address risky sexual behaviors.

      "Four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 1,691 participants were included in the analysis for the outcome of unintended pregnancy. The interventions consisted of a mix of tailored feedback sessions via computer and individual counseling. The pooled analysis showed no significant difference between the intervention and control groups in preventing unintended pregnancy, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.88 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.73 to 1.05. Similarly, subgroup analysis based on contact time and intervention type did not show a significant difference between intervention and control groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "One study was not included in the pooled analysis because the study authors did not report the number of recorded pregnancies per group. However, they did not report a significant difference between the intervention and control groups in terms of preventing unintended pregnancies.\n",
      "\n",
      "For sexually transmitted infections (STIs), fifteen RCTs with a total of 50,521 participants were included in the analysis. The interventions varied from individual and group counseling to media-based strategies, including web-based, video, and text messaging approaches. Pooled results indicated a lower risk of STIs with the intervention compared to control, with an RR of 0.86 and a 95% CI of 0.76 to 0.97. However, there was moderate heterogeneity (I² = 44%). Subgroup analysis according to contact time showed that low-contact counseling significantly reduced the risk of STIs compared to control, with an RR of 0.85 and a 95% CI of 0.78 to 0.92, whereas interventions with moderate or high contact time did not. In terms of intervention type, group counseling interventions prevented STIs, with an RR of 0.75 and a 95% CI of 0.64 to 0.88, while individual counseling and media-based interventions did not.\n",
      "Pooled results from six Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) involving 2,069 participants with a mean age range of 20.4 to 35.5 years did not demonstrate a significant difference in the incidence of unprotected intercourse between the intervention and control groups (mean difference -0.56 [95% Confidence Interval (CI) -1.58 to 0.46]). There was moderate heterogeneity across these studies, indicated by an I² value of 52%.

Subgroup analyses by contact time and intervention type yielded similar results. One study with 402 participants, included in the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) analysis, was excluded from our meta-analysis because it did not report event rates.\n",

At the three-month follow-up, there was no significant difference in depression, anxiety, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) scores between the intervention and control groups (range of mean differences: -3.04 [95% CI -6.65 to 0.57] to 0.95 [95% CI -0.73 to 2.63]).\n",

      "The evidence did not show significant adverse effects with counseling on safe sex. While rural health units already stock condoms, there remains a high resource requirement in terms of training and distributing personnel. Patient burden is likely low, and several panelists view the non-pharmacologic interventions as cost-effective and beneficial. Preferences and acceptability may differ from other geographical regions, and Filipino sexual attitudes are shaped by the predominant religion. Health promotion and disease prevention (i.e., sexually transmitted infections) are aligned with universal healthcare goals. The burden of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and teenage pregnancy is also of concern, and so early intervention for high-risk individuals is desirable. Adolescents still require the consent of their parents and are economically dependent on the latter. The existence of adolescent-friendly health facilities may aid with implementation.\n",

      "4.3.1 Burden of Disease\n",
      "The last Young Adult Fertility and Sexuality Study in the Philippines (YAFS4), conducted in 2013, observed an increasing proportion of youth who have begun sexual activity before the age of 18, with an almost two-fold increase to 23% in 2013 from 13% in 1994. [1] In 2008, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported that one in three births was unplanned, either unwanted or mistimed. [PSA] In the Philippines, it is estimated that there are almost 2 million unintended pregnancies per year and over 600,000 unsafe abortions. It was also stated that only 3% of women who desired to avoid pregnancy received contraceptive counseling. [High Rates of Unintended Pregnancies 2019] The YAFS4 survey also revealed that the proportion of 15- to 19-year-old individuals who have already gotten pregnant increased two-fold from 6.3% in 2002 to 13.6% in 2013. [1] Risky sexual behaviors lead to complications such as unintended pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections, and mental health issues. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), unwanted pregnancies may lead to serious health risks to the mother, which may include malnutrition, abuse, unsafe abortion, and even death. [High Rates of Unintended Pregnancies 2019] Untreated sexually transmitted infections may lead to other conditions that ultimately cause a considerable burden to patients. [Chesson 2017] In 2016, the Philippines became the fastest-growing epidemic in HIV in the Asia-Pacific region, with the majority of new cases occurring among 15- to 24-year-old males who have sex with males and transgender women who have sex with males. [Philippines Addresses Rising Trend in New HIV Infections 2021] Filipinos are prevented from getting adequate access to sexual and reproductive health care due to socio-cultural and political factors. [2] These structural inequalities lead to varying health interventions received by patients. Management would depend on whether complications from risky sexual behaviors took place.

      "*   For both Filipino adults and adolescents who screen positive for high-risk sexual behaviors, the CPG recommends the use of non-pharmacologic interventions on safe sex to prevent:\n",
      "    *   Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)\n",
      "    *   Unintended pregnancy\n",
      "    *   Unprotected intercourse\n",
      "    *   To promote consistent condom use\n",
      "\n",
      "*   The CPG indicates that group counseling interventions have been shown to reduce the incidence of STIs compared to the control group.\n",
      "*   For adolescents, interventions with high contact time decreased the incidence of STIs compared to the control group.\n",
      "*   For adults, low-contact counseling significantly reduced the risk of STIs compared to control.\n",

      "**Additional Notes**:\n",
      "*   The certainty of evidence for these recommendations is low for adults and very low for adolescents, but the strength of the recommendation is strong for both groups.\n",
      "*   The CPG also notes that there was no significant difference in the effects of contact time (moderate vs. high contact time) or type of counseling (group vs. individual counseling) on unintended pregnancy among adolescents.\n",
      "*   For adults, pooled analysis showed no significant difference between the intervention and control groups in preventing unintended pregnancy.\n",

It is important to recognize the significance of screening individuals for cardiovascular diseases, especially those who are asymptomatic and apparently healthy.\\n- **Obesity**: Along with smoking, obesity is another identified factor that can lead to cardiovascular death. Addressing obesity through lifestyle modifications is essential for reducing cardiovascular risk.\\n- **Dietary Recommendations**: A diet emphasizing the intake of vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, whole grains, and fish is recommended to decrease ASCVD risk factors. Replacement of saturated fat with dietary monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats can be beneficial. A diet containing reduced amounts of cholesterol and sodium can also be beneficial. Minimizing the intake of processed meats, refined carbohydrates, and sweetened beverages is reasonable to reduce ASCVD risk. Avoiding the intake of trans fats is also recommended.\\n\\n**Additional Notes**:\\n- The guidelines emphasize evidence-based recommendations to promote health and prevent disease through non-pharmacologic interventions.\\n- The consensus panel considered the importance of identifying modifiable risk factors such as smoking and elevated blood sugars when formulating recommendations.\\n\\n**Citation**:\\n- **Source Title**: [CPG] Periodic Health Examination_ Screening for Cardiovascular Disease.pdf\\n  - Page Numbers: 14, 15, 16\\n- **Source Title**: [CPG] Periodic Health Examination_ Lifestyle Advice.pdf\\n  - Page Numbers: 71', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='run-71fd279a-d786-4e91-a309-c153b47d676b', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 4351, 'output_tokens': 419, 'total_tokens': 4770})]"
